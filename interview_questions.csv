How did you know about this position/ vacancy?,"I have carefully studied both the job description and the person specification, so I am fully aware of the duties and responsibilities of this role."
What was the biggest mistake of your life?,"I think the worst mistake I ever made at work was in my first ever job - five years ago now. A more senior member of the team seemed to take an instant dislike to me from the start, and one day she was particularly unpleasant to me in front of several colleagues.Later on, I was talking to one of those colleagues who was, I thought, attempting to console me. Angry and hurt, I foolishly vented my feelings and told her what I thought of the lady in question. I was naturally shocked to find out that she went on to tell everyone what I had said and this certainly didn't help my relationship with the team member who was causing me problems.Rather than let the situation carry on, I chose to have a quiet word with this lady to find out what her problem was with me and to see if we could put it behind us. It turned out it was nothing personal; she just resented the fact that a friend of hers had also been interviewed for my position and had been turned down. Once we had got matters out into the air, her behavior changed, and we got on quite well after that. However, I certainly learned a lot from experience.

What is your greatest fear?,"Before some time, public speaking has been a challenge for me. I was very nervous and hesitate while giving any presentation, so I started taking public speaking seminars to improve it. Now, I still get nervous before pitches, but I have learned how to remain calm and get the job done right. | As you know that I have never worked in my life and this is my first job, my inexperience is my weakness. But I beg to differ. I am confident and a fast learner. I assure you that I will perform my job without carrying any pre-conceived notions regarding how I feel."
Explain the difference between group and team?,"There is only one difference between the group and the team. That is unity. Any set of people who stand together without any purpose or goal can be called as Group. Whereas, when more than 2 people work towards a common goal, can be called as a Team. For example: If you assign work to a group, then the work will be divided between the members and each member will work out their part, without any coordination with the other members of the group. On the other hand, if you assign a project to a team, they will collectively take the responsibility and work together with the goal to achieve the desired result. In a team, the members will cooperate and coordinate with each other at all times."
What will you do if you don't get this position?,"I have high hopes that I will be selected.

I don't think that I will have any problem with the traveling involved. | Yes, as part of growing up. I used to travel a lot as my father is an ex-serviceman hence occasionally he used to be posted throughout the country. Though I would prefer my city as it is my birthplace and all my friends and relatives are there, but at the same time, I am ok with relocating."
Is there anything which makes you different from other candidates?,"Although, I am not familiar with the others whom you are interviewing for this position. I am sure many talented people applying for the job. But because of my background and the problem-solving skills, I considered myself to be a strong candidate for this position. | I understand that success is not always guaranteed but there is still hope, and I never lose the faith, whether I succeed or not. I think this power makes me stand alone from all other candidates. | I have exceptional organizational skills. In my last job, I created a project which was termed as quite creative by the clients. I think my technical skills make me stand alone from all other candidates."
Describe the three things that are most important for you in a job?,"According to me, Honesty, Loyalty, and determination to achieve my team's target are the three important things in a job. | According to me, Professionalism, growth and a healthy work-life balance are the three important things in a job."

Whenever I am down my mother helps me to push my limits, and she always keeps me on the track. She was scolding me whenever I do something wrong. She is everything for me, I still got inspired from her, how she manages every problem in every situation."
Do you have any questions for me?,"Thank you for giving me this opportunity. After my overall performance till now if I got selected what I need to improve and if I'm not selected how can I succeed further. Can you give any advice sir? | First of all thank you very much, for being so much polite & friendly to me throughout the session, that I can express myself so easily.
