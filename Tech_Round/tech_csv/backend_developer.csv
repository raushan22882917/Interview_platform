RESTful Services,What is the difference between PUT and POST?,"PUT is idempotent and used to update a resource, while POST is used to create a new resource and is not idempotent.","PUT replaces an existing resource, while POST creates a new resource, often resulting in different URLs.","PUT updates a resource at a specified URL, while POST submits data to create a new resource, which may generate a new URL."
RESTful Services,What is HATEOAS?,"HATEOAS stands for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, a constraint of REST that allows clients to navigate the API dynamically.","HATEOAS enables clients to interact with the API entirely through hypermedia links provided by the server.","HATEOAS is a principle that allows clients to discover actions dynamically through hypermedia links, enhancing the usability of APIs."
RESTful Services,How do you handle versioning in REST APIs?,"Versioning can be handled through URL paths, request headers, or query parameters, allowing clients to specify the desired version.","APIs can implement versioning using URL segments, query strings, or custom headers to manage different versions.","Versioning can be achieved through various strategies like URL path versioning, request header versioning, or query parameter versioning."
Authentication,What is OAuth?,"OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used for token-based authentication.","OAuth is a protocol that allows third-party services to exchange information without exposing credentials.","OAuth is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on HTTP services."
Authentication,What is the difference between OAuth and OpenID Connect?,"OAuth is primarily for authorization, while OpenID Connect adds an identity layer on top of OAuth.","OAuth handles authorization, whereas OpenID Connect provides user authentication and identity management.","OAuth focuses on authorization, while OpenID Connect extends OAuth to provide user identity verification."
Authentication,What are JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)?,"JWTs are compact, URL-safe tokens used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.","JWTs are used for authentication and information exchange, containing encoded claims about the user.","JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are an open standard for securely transmitting information as a JSON object, often used for user authentication."
Authentication,What is the role of session management in authentication?,"Session management tracks user activity and maintains user state during interactions with a web application.","Session management is crucial for maintaining user authentication and storing user-specific data between requests.","Session management is essential for ensuring a seamless user experience by tracking user state and managing user sessions effectively."
Authentication,How do you implement secure password storage?,"Secure password storage involves hashing passwords with algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.","Passwords should be hashed and salted using strong algorithms to protect against brute-force attacks.","To securely store passwords, use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt, combined with a unique salt for each password."
Microservices,What are microservices?,"Microservices are a software development technique where an application is composed of small, independent services.","Microservices architecture allows developers to build applications as a suite of small services.","Microservices are a design approach where applications are developed as a collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability."
Microservices,What are the benefits of using microservices?,"Benefits include improved scalability, easier deployment, and better fault isolation.","Microservices enable teams to develop, deploy, and scale services independently, improving agility and reliability.","Microservices offer scalability, flexibility in technology choices, and the ability to deploy and update services independently."
Microservices,What is service discovery?,"Service discovery is the process by which a service can find and communicate with other services in a microservices architecture.","Service discovery enables services to locate each other dynamically, enhancing communication in microservices environments.","Service discovery helps microservices identify and interact with other services efficiently, typically through a registry."
Microservices,How do you handle communication between microservices?,"Communication can be handled via REST APIs, message queues, or gRPC, depending on the use case.","Microservices can communicate using synchronous methods like REST or asynchronous methods like message brokers.","Communication methods include REST for synchronous calls and message queues or gRPC for asynchronous messaging between services."
Microservices,What is circuit breaking in microservices?,"Circuit breaking is a design pattern used to prevent a service from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that's likely to fail.","Circuit breakers help prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service after a set threshold is met.","Circuit breaking is a resilience pattern that prevents the system from trying to execute operations that are likely to fail, enhancing fault tolerance."
Error Handling,How do you handle errors in an API?,"Error handling in an API involves using HTTP status codes and providing meaningful error messages in responses.","APIs typically handle errors by returning an appropriate status code and an error message in the response body.","Effective error handling in APIs includes returning standardized HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages to help clients diagnose issues."
Error Handling,What are common HTTP status codes?,"Common HTTP status codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 400 (Bad Request).","Common status codes include 200 for success, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors, among others.","Standard HTTP status codes include 200 for success, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors, indicating various outcomes of requests."
Error Handling,What is a fallback mechanism in error handling?,"A fallback mechanism provides an alternative response when a service fails, ensuring continued functionality.","Fallbacks allow applications to use alternative methods or cached data when an error occurs, enhancing resilience.","A fallback mechanism offers alternative responses or actions when an initial request fails, improving user experience during errors."
Error Handling,How do you log errors in a backend application?,"Errors should be logged with sufficient detail, including timestamps, error messages, and stack traces, to aid troubleshooting.","Logging errors involves recording relevant information about exceptions and errors for future analysis and debugging.","Error logging should capture detailed context, including timestamps and relevant data, to facilitate debugging and monitoring."
Error Handling,What is the importance of monitoring in error handling?,"Monitoring helps detect errors and performance issues in real-time, allowing for prompt resolution.","Monitoring is crucial for identifying and addressing errors before they impact users, ensuring system reliability.","Effective monitoring enables proactive identification and resolution of errors, maintaining application performance and user satisfaction."
