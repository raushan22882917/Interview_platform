Quantify Internship Achievements

When you’re short on work experience, the key to making your internships and projects shine is to focus on the results you achieved. Instead of just listing your responsibilities, explain what you accomplished and the skills you used to get there. 

Did you increase website traffic by 10% through your marketing project? Did you manage a team project that came in under budget? Mention that! Quantify your achievements whenever possible, and show how your work made a real impact. This will grab the employer’s attention and show them you’re a go-getter, even with limited experience.

Kimberley Tyler-Smith, VP of Strategy and Growth, Resume Worded

 

Showcase Results and Transferable Skills

Showing off accurate results is essential for college students who want to showcase their internships and projects, despite having little work experience. 

Even a small project can make a significant impact. 

For example, if you increased network efficiency during your internship, show how much faster it became or how much less time you spent on the network.

Don’t forget to tell stories. Create a resume or portfolio that tells the story of your experiences. 

Tell stories about the obstacles you faced and how you overcame them creatively. Problem-solving and adaptability are two skills employers love to see in you.

And don’t forget to take advantage of any transferable skills you acquired while interning. 

Did you learn how to communicate better with your team? Or perhaps you learned how to manage your time more effectively under tight deadlines. Both of these skills are valuable in any work environment.

Lastly, make sure you’re networking like it’s the 21st century. Attend industry gatherings, network with experts on LinkedIn, and seek out in-depth interviews. There’s never a dull moment when a connection is made.

Don’t forget that experience isn’t about quantity; it’s about quality and relevance.

Laviet Joaquin, Marketing Head, TP-Link

 

Dedicate a Resume Section for Projects

To effectively showcase internships or projects with limited work experience, college students should create a dedicated resume section. Describe projects with quantifiable achievements, use action verbs, and include relevant technical skills to impress potential employers.

Kristina Ramos, Reverse Recruiter, Find My Profession

 

Match Skills to Job Requirements

As a recruiter, fresh graduates who mention job-relevant skills they developed or polished while working on a project or as an intern stand out to me. Therefore, I recommend carefully reviewing the job description and making note of the specific skills, experiences, and qualifications required for the position. You can then reflect on your past internships or projects and identify instances where you have gained relevant skills and experiences that match the job requirements.

On your resume, it’s best to provide concrete examples and details of your accomplishments during your internships/projects, including any relevant metrics or results achieved. For instance, if the job requires experience using certain software that you actually used at your internship, make sure to mention that in bold text under your internship details in the Work Experience section of your resume. Tying your experiences back to the job requirements and demonstrating how they have prepared you for success in the position is key to getting hired when you have no actual employment history.

Joe Coletta, Founder & CEO, 180 Engineering

 

Align Work with Job Description Keywords

The best way to highlight your internship and project experience is by aligning the work you’ve done to the job description, using keywords and mirroring phrases. Emphasize whatever component of your internship or project that matches the job you are applying to, instead of listing out everything you did. 

Also, be sure to focus on the actual work you did, the steps you implemented, and any initiative you took; do not spend precious space describing the project or the internship program.

Mofei Xu, Career Coach, Mofei Xu Career Coaching

 

Develop a Case Study or Portfolio

Create a case study or portfolio feature for the work that was completed during your internship or project. Showing that you are going above and beyond to highlight the relevant experience in a way that can be easily connected to professional duties will help connect the dots for hiring managers.

Jason Miller, Digital Marketing Manager, York University

 

Highlight Applied Skills and Results

Noting internships and fellowships on a resume is a wonderful way to build work experience. Some of these experiences may be rewarded through academic course credit, monetary pay, and/or custom recognition channels. Even unpaid opportunities, aside from volunteer work, contribute as a valuable source when building a professional portfolio of work. Hosting skill sets is fine, but it holds no merit until individuals can prove they’re applying these skill sets in real-life settings. 

When theory translates to application, then there’s a reason for employers to take interest in exploring how these potential candidates can optimally contribute to their organizations. The resume can exhibit different genres of projects that you’ve worked on by stating the objective of the internship/fellowship, sharing the tasks that were assigned during the duration of the commitment, and disclosing lessons learned from the project. Make sure to quantify certain aspects of your work experience so employers can automatically learn the duration of your commitment and understand the measurable metrics that were used to track performance. 

For example, if a student had to produce X reports within a week at their internship, they need to frame the context of their contribution without appearing too nebulous. They were chosen to honor such roles for a reason; therefore, highlight the strengths through skills that were applied and new skills that were acquired. Ambitious employers are seeking candidates who are willing to showcase their ongoing professional development while paying attention to the results of their work.

Sasha Laghonh, Founder, Sasha Talks

 

Treat Internships as Professional Experience

Experience is experience. College students should create a resume highlighting internships and projects in the same way they would a paid position and speak to them in interviews. 

Be mindful of the keywords called out in the job(s) they are applying for and interviewing for when describing responsibilities and skills acquired. The key is to clearly outline what they’ve learned and the successes they’ve accomplished.

Mandy Schaniel, Founder & CEO, Schaniel Consulting Inc.

 

Include Strong References for Backup

Sometimes all you need is a little backup when it comes to quantifying your achievements that were garnered outside of the workplace. This is where references come in handy. Be sure to include references from supervisors, professors, or mentors who can speak to your skills, work ethic, and performance during your internships or projects. A positive reference can strengthen your application and validate your qualifications, making it more likely for you to stand out against others who might be in the same position.

Make sure to mention these references in the interview process and provide them without needing to be asked. This makes it more of a seamless process and creates less work for recruiters.

Michael Banis, Chief Development Officer, Virtue Recovery Centers

 

Emphasize the Value Added to Organizations

As an organizational perspective, we are keen to know more about the internship in terms of how it has been beneficial or added value to the organization. Students often make the usual mistake of explaining the project’s WHAT & HOW, but I would suggest more representation on WHY is required, and it should touch the prospective organization.

Vipul Annadate, Manager HR, K D Aher Building Systems Pvt. Ltd.

 

Craft Targeted Resumes and Cover Letters

College students with limited work experience can effectively highlight their internships or relevant projects by crafting targeted resumes and cover letters. Focus on showcasing specific achievements, skills, and experiences gained during internships or projects, emphasizing relevant tasks and accomplishments. 

Additionally, leverage online platforms such as LinkedIn to create a professional profile highlighting these experiences, engaging in networking opportunities, and joining relevant groups or communities to connect with professionals in the field. 

Finally, during interviews, confidently articulate the value and skills acquired through internships or projects, demonstrating enthusiasm and a proactive attitude toward learning and professional development.

Steven Mostyn, Chief Human Resources Officer, Management.org

 

Collect and Display Social Proof

Use social proof to highlight your projects. Make sure to release the projects and keep them live on a website. 

Additionally, you can launch them on platforms like GitHub/Product Hunt. When you list your project in the resume, highlight social metrics like GitHub stars, Product Hunt rank, or even website visitors, and include a link to your website. This is a good way to stand out from the crowd.

Deepti Chopra, Co-founder, Adaface

 

Build a Strong Personal Brand

I emphasize the significance of harnessing the power of personal branding for college students aiming to stand out with their internships or relevant projects. Crafting a personal brand that resonates with their career aspirations and professional ethos can serve as a beacon for potential employers.

This can be achieved by consistently sharing insights, learnings, and achievements related to their field of interest across social media and professional networking platforms. Curating content that reflects their professional identity and expertise not only showcases their dedication and passion but also positions them as thought leaders among their peers.

By authentically communicating their unique values and visions, students can effectively highlight their potential and readiness for the professional world, even with limited work experience. Thus, personal branding emerges as a strategic tool in bridging the gap between their current academic pursuits and future career goals.

Amit Doshi, Founder & CEO, MyTurn

 

Be Honest About Your Experience

Be honest about your level of experience and don’t try to pad out your past roles if it’s not necessary. Be open about the experience you do have, and be willing to communicate that experience (do not lie or worry about a seemingly lesser amount of experience in your roles).

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Create a Project Portfolio Section

I recommend that college students create a Project Portfolio segment in their resumes or LinkedIn profiles to highlight their internships or relevant projects. This goes beyond merely listing the internships or projects; it’s about storytelling and showcasing the impact of their work through a curated collection of tangible outcomes, learnings, and visual aids.

We often look for candidates who can demonstrate their contributions and learning experiences visually and contextually. For a college student, this could include links to digital portfolios, project websites, or even brief video presentations summarizing key projects undertaken during their internships.

Each project in the portfolio should highlight specific skills used, challenges overcome, and the value added to the project or internship role. For example, if a student worked on a marketing campaign for a new product, they could include campaign visuals, any data on increased engagement or sales, and a brief analysis of what strategies worked and what they learned.

When stepping into an interview, aligning your career aspirations with the company’s vision can be a game-changer. We’ve gathered insights from CEOs and senior consultants, among others, to bring you fourteen strategic tips. From showcasing your strengths and proposing initiatives to asking strategic questions, discover how to resonate with your future employer’s vision.

Showcase Strengths and Propose Initiatives

When aligning your career goals with the vision of a company you are interviewing with, it’s essential to demonstrate how your strengths can contribute to the company’s success while addressing any potential gaps. 

During the interview, emphasize your existing strengths that directly align with the company’s vision and goals. Highlight specific skills, experiences, and achievements that demonstrate your ability to contribute to the company’s success. For example, if the company is focused on innovation and you have a track record of implementing creative solutions in your previous roles, emphasize this as a strength that you can bring to the new company. 

By showcasing your existing strengths, you can illustrate how you are well-positioned to support the company’s vision from day one. Consider the potential gaps or areas where the company may benefit from your expertise. During the interview, propose specific action items that you can focus on to enhance the company’s business value and profitability. This could involve outlining potential projects, initiatives, or strategies that align with the company’s vision and can contribute to its growth. 

By presenting concrete action items, you demonstrate your proactive approach and commitment to driving the company toward its strategic goals. The key is to showcase not only your qualifications and experience but also your strategic thinking and proactive mindset.

Yemisi Iyilade, Senior Consultant, YEMISIIYILADE.COM

 

Analyze LinkedIn Profiles and Company Culture

Your best insight into the company’s culture and beliefs is not coming from their website; that’s an advertisement. The most honest places where they portray themselves are on the LinkedIn personal profiles of the principals and officers and on the company’s profile page. Read what they are saying there about themselves and their adherence to the company’s mission, both on the surface and deeper between the lines. Notice how they post news about the company and other material to share with their industry. Determine if they lead the industry with original thought or follow along with little value added. 

You want to be part of a mover-and-shaker company, not a laggard. Before your interview, get the names of everyone you will meet in HR and in management, and review their personal profiles to beef up the questions you can ask them about themselves, their history there, and promotions within the company, their perspective on why you may want to work there that is not obvious from their LinkedIn presence. Make this interview a dual conversation, with foreknowledge and prior research, not one where they ask you all the questions.

Marc W. Halpert, LinkedIn coach, trainer, marketing consultant, connect2collaborate.com

 

Inquire About Promotion Tracks

I recommend that candidates should always ask what the promotion track looks like for the job they are applying for. If the role they would have one to two promotions down the line aligns with their career goals, then they will be even more excited to join the company and motivated by their work. On the flip side, if it isn’t of interest to them, then they might have issues staying motivated and finding their work rewarding.

Corey Schwitz, CEO & Founder, Skydog Ops

 

Become an Aspirational Archaeologist

Beyond superficial sound bites, genuine alignment springs from marrying your unique growth trajectory to an organization’s transformative path forward. Early on, I coached candidates to parrot mission statements verbatim. Quickly, I realized leaders crave contributors who deeply internalize values as personal guideposts for impact. Now, I advise job seekers to become archaeologists of aspiration—excavate beneath polished positioning to unearth the raw human hopes propelling a company’s existence. 

Scour interviews, press releases, and even Glassdoor reviews to decode their distinct dialect of purpose. Then, trace how your specific skills and experiences can accelerate their evolution. Perhaps you’re a data scientist passionate about ethical AI, pursuing roles with healthcare startups pioneering equitable diagnosis algorithms. Articulate how your blend of technical chops and social consciousness uniquely equips you to responsibly scale their products while safeguarding patient trust. 

The key is positioning yourself as a co-creator, not just an employee. Ignite imagination around how you’ll materially advance their mission through the vehicle of your own career vision. Alignment shines when individual and institutional ambitions share a horizon.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-founder and CEO, EchoGlobal Tech

 

Match Career Goals with Corporate Values

Start by searching the “About Us” section of the company’s website and looking for their Corporate Values. This list of values will let you know what the company thinks is most important in a prospective candidate for hire. (They are actually telling you what to focus on during the interview.) The list will also closely align with the company’s corporate vision.

Look for ways that you can match up your career goals with these values and the corporate vision.

For example, if the number one value is “Quality,” ask yourself, “If the company hires me for this position, in what ways would I be able to improve quality for them?” Think about ways that you have accomplished that in prior work that you have done. Have those examples ready when you walk in for the interview!

Doug Staneart, CEO, Fearless Presentations

 

Be Honest About Personal and Professional Seasons

Consider your life situation and the season of your life, both professionally and personally. Be honest if you are re-entering a career after taking care of your kids for the past five years, if you are a caregiver for an aging parent, if you are in a transition in your life such as a divorce, a state move, or any other situation you are currently in. The employer will appreciate your openness and honesty upfront, as well as how they can work with you to align the workload and your schedule. 

There will always be changes in the seasons of life, so make sure that your employer knows you are committed to bringing your best and contributing to the growth and development of the company. Whether you are just starting in your career or advancing in it, don’t be afraid to tell the company what you hope to accomplish in your career. Make sure you ask questions during the interview that will help you maintain a healthy work-life balance and allow you to advance within the organization.

Olga Kovtun, Marketing Coordinator, HRPro

 

Validate Company Vision with Employee Insights

I think the better challenge is to first look at the vision of a company and learn everything you can about that company—you can start with the basics like a website or LinkedIn Company Page. But the more important exercise is to talk to a few people who actually work there via networking; ask them their thoughts about the company’s vision. See how their answers compare to the company’s marketing of it. 

Once you have validated what they say and what others confirm it’s really like, if that opportunity is of interest to you, now it’s important to see how it stacks up to your career goals. Is it a fit? Let’s assume it is for the sake of an upcoming job interview.

When you go through your STAR or PAR examples, what ways can you use examples that align with the company’s vision from what you have done in the past? When you prep for questions about yourself and what you want, how can you craft authentic answers that relate to your goals and their vision? Interviews are about selling yourself, so by doing the research to know what your audience is looking for, it next becomes your job to focus on selling yourself into that equation.

Working with a coach to hone in on this strategy can be really beneficial because most candidates are too surface-level with their approach; one needs to go deeper and more technical in their answers while being true to themselves to stand out.

Nikki Ryberg, MHRLR, CPRW, GCDF, Career Coach, Ryberg Group, LLC

 

Engage in Early Skills Alignment Conversations

Candidates can align their career goals with the vision of the company they are interviewing with by engaging in early conversations that uncover skills or competencies needed to assist in carrying out the vision of the company at the level of the employee. 

For example, if interviewing for Amazon for a customer service position and knowing their vision is, “Our vision is to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online,” the employee may pursue podcasts such as “Creating Disney Magic: Lessons in Leadership, Management, and Customer Service” or similar podcasts to help develop skills that are synergistic with the vision and pertinent to the customer service role.

Celeste Davis, CPO

 

Create a Vision Integration Map

My best tip is to create a Vision Integration Map.

First, thoroughly research the company’s vision, mission, and recent initiatives. Then, draw up a map that visually connects your past experiences, skills, and aspirations with various aspects of the company’s vision. This could be a mind map or a simple chart. The idea is to create a visual representation that clearly shows how your career trajectory and achievements align with and can also contribute to advancing the company’s strategic goals.

For example, if the company is committed to sustainability and you’ve worked on projects that reduced waste or improved energy efficiency, highlight these experiences in your map. If innovation is a core part of the company’s mission, detail how your innovative thinking or past projects have led to successful outcomes. This method allows you to enter the interview with a straightforward, compelling narrative demonstrating alignment and actively contributing to the company’s future.

Presenting this Vision Integration Map during your interview can set you apart as a candidate who has not only done their homework but also creatively thought about how they can be an asset to the team. It showcases your analytical skills, ability to synthesize information meaningfully, and genuine interest in contributing to the company’s success.

This helps candidates demonstrate a deep alignment with a company’s vision, making it clear they’re not just looking for any job, but a role in which they can actively participate in the company’s journey and contribute to its long-term success.

Laurie Hyllberg, Vice President, Kinsa Group

 

Research and Share Passionate Examples

Research. Check out the hiring company’s mission statement, About page, their work, social posts, etc., and try to find common ground with your own career goals and interests. You can even go one step further and share a direct example with some specificity to impress further while trying to bring aspects you’re passionate about into the mix. The more passionate and committed you come across, the higher your chances of landing the job become.

Christopher Thoma, Head of Media, CareerAddict

 

Highlight Skills that Complement Company Values

During the interview, be prepared to discuss how your career goals align with the vision and values of the company. Highlight specific areas where your skills, experiences, and values complement those of the company. 

For example, if the company values innovation and you have a track record of introducing new ideas or processes, emphasize how you can contribute to the company’s culture of innovation.

Terry Jackson, COO

 

Sell What the Buyer Is Buying

Candidates can align their career goals with the vision of the company they are interviewing with by asking questions during the interview. In other words, you want to sell what the buyer is buying. However, you can only do that by asking follow-up questions during the interview to ensure that you have all the information. 

For example, when an interviewer asks why you’re interested in the role, ask them to share more. This will allow you to align your responses further within the process, including your career goals.

Valerie Martinelli, MPA, CEO , Valerie Martinelli Consulting, LLC 

 

Weave Career Story with Company’s Vision

And then, it is the golden tip for the candidate: how to align career goals with the vision of the company with which the interview is taking place. The candidate should see the strategic opportunity during the course of the interview so as to show how they can be aligned with the company’s mission and goals.

This should come through by immersing oneself deeply in understanding the mission statement, the values, and the larger objectives that the company has previously set. By understanding these key facts, a candidate will be in a better position to explain in a manner that shows how their career aspirations aren’t just in cooperation but in collaboration with the company’s vision.

Then the candidates cleverly weave their career story into the fabric of the company’s vision during the interview itself, not to state future goals as classic teacher questions suppose, but to show how the few goals they do have are in favor of the path the firm could be on. This perhaps means linking certain skills or experiences to an individual that could directly correlate with the goals of the company.

This will further be achieved when candidates ask questions that bring to the forefront how the vision is achievable with their involvement. Actually, this not only points out the zeal and interest in seeking to understand the vision of the company but also underscores the eagerness to have a significant contribution in achieving that vision.

Viktoriia Prydatko, HR and Tech Recruiter, HireDevelopersBiz

 

Research Company and Ask Strategic Questions

Before the interview, thoroughly research the company’s mission statement, values, and long-term goals. Understand what they stand for, what they aim to achieve, and how they differentiate themselves from competitors. This will provide you with insight into their overall vision. 

Then, throughout the interview, take the opportunity to ask questions that further demonstrate your alignment with the company’s vision. Inquire about upcoming initiatives, challenges, or opportunities that relate to your career goals. This shows your genuine interest in contributing to the company’s success in areas that matter to both you and the company you are interviewing with.

Showcase Real Weaknesses with Improvement Strategies

Years back, the practiced answer was usually something along the lines of “I work too hard” or “I’m a perfectionist.” We tended to look for answers that would make the companies like us. Now, too many people have adopted that approach, and companies are turned off by the lack of vulnerability these answers offer. This puts candidates in a tricky spot because being too honest could backfire.

I think answers that involve specific examples of a few areas where things come harder but also offer ways they’ve improved (systems, processes, courses, etc.) are great. I also think using real weaknesses but then selling why they are actually a strength can be good, too. 

For instance, I’m too impatient at times, which can lead to impulsive decisions, but it also means I never miss a deadline and am always early to meetings. I have learned this about myself and now put parameters in place, such as strategies X and Y, to ensure I do the due diligence I need to before making a critical decision.

An answer like this is real; it can show the positive aspect of the trait and the real-life workaround one implements because of it.

Nikki Ryberg, MHRLR, CPRW, GCDF, Career Coach, Ryberg Group, LLC

 

Lead with Authenticity and Highlight Improvement Steps

Honesty is a powerful tool when answering difficult interview questions, including those about your “weaknesses” or areas of opportunity. Although you want to be careful not to mention being bad at something that is listed in the basic job requirements, you don’t have to try to turn your weakness into a strength either. Instead, lead with authenticity and highlight the steps you’re taking to improve.

If you’re struggling to come up with weaknesses, turn to your performance evaluations to see what feedback you’ve received in the past. You can also look to those around you for feedback. This can be as simple as asking, “I’m preparing for an upcoming job interview. Can you please share a few of my greatest strengths as well as my biggest weakness?”

Dr. Kyle Elliott, Founder & Tech Career Coach, CaffeinatedKyle.com

 

Combine Humor with Active Solutions

When you’re hit with the “weaknesses” question in an interview, it’s a golden opportunity. Start with a little humor, maybe confessing your love for puns or your knack for turning any situation into a sitcom-worthy joke. Then, get down to the nitty-gritty by admitting something genuine, such as overcommitting due to enthusiasm or being too critical of your own work. 

Wrap it up by highlighting how you’re actively working on these areas, whether it’s through time-management techniques, seeking feedback, or honing your skills. It’s about being authentic, a little funny, and demonstrating your dedication to self-improvement.

Crystal Clark, Communications Manager, City of Tampa

 

Frame Weakness in Context of Proactive Improvement

When faced with the “weakness” question, the best approach is to be candid while framing it in the context of proactive improvement. Start by choosing a genuine area where you’ve faced challenges, but make sure it’s not a critical skill for the role you’re applying for. Then discuss specific steps you’ve taken to address this weakness. 

For example, if you struggle with public speaking, you might want to say: “I’ve always found public speaking to be stressful, which I know is important for teamwork and leadership. To improve, I’ve joined a local Toastmasters club to communicate my ideas clearly and with confidence.” This approach will show honesty, your willingness to keep working on yourself, and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities for growth.

Bayu Prihandito, Founder, Psychology Consultant, Life Coach for Men, Life Architekture

 

Focus on Learning and Growth Over Cliché Answers

Flip the answer to what you hope to learn or improve. Instead of the cliché answer “I’m a perfectionist,” try: “I’m learning that progress matters more than perfection.” Instead of “I work too hard,” try: “I had to recognize that what I thought was working too hard was actually me being inefficient, so I worked on my time management and organizational skills.” What you are doing here is showing self-awareness and growth versus saying what you think they want to hear.

Mathew Fox, Founder, Embedded Talent

 

Demonstrate Commitment to Enhancing Weaknesses

Candidates can approach the “weaknesses” question in a way that doesn’t truly admit a weakness. Demonstrate that you are trying to enhance your “weakness” through your commitment to self-improvement with a plan to turn it into a strength and how it could benefit others. Be candid in your responses because it demonstrates humility and the fact that you’re not perfect, but that you are learning and willing to take action to improve yourself when needed.

Valerie Martinelli, MPA, CEO, Valerie Martinelli Consulting, LLC 

 

Use Feedback to Show Growth and Continuous Improvement

I believe what employers are really trying to get at when they ask the ‘tell me your greatest weakness’ question (which could really be worded in a much better, more behaviorally based way) is to determine where a candidate needs to grow or what areas they will need support in, and also to see how a candidate has acted on those areas. 

A great way to answer this is to give an example of previous feedback you’ve received from a leader, manager, or supervisor on an opportunity to improve, and then showcase what steps you have taken to act on that feedback. 

For example, you could say, “In my previous performance reviews, an area of growth for me has been time management. I’ve made strides to improve in that area by leveraging my electronic calendar better, using an app to manage my to-do list, and taking a virtual course on prioritization.” This gives the employer real-life, behaviorally based answers and an example of an area you need to work on, as well as demonstrates your ability to accept negative feedback and act on it to ensure you are meeting expectations. 

Overall, I believe it is key for a candidate to approach this question in a way that demonstrates that “weaknesses” are really just opportunities for continuous improvement, and that you are always striving to be a better version of yourself. Everyone has areas to work on, so don’t be ashamed or try to guess what the employer wants to hear. Give an honest, real-life example and demonstrate how you have worked on that opportunity, and you will have nothing to fear!

Heather Kerr, Human Resources Manager

 

Share a Journey from Recognizing to Overcoming Weakness

A good friend of mine, when asked in interviews to identify his biggest weakness, would answer, “chocolate.” Typically, the interviewer and my friend would share a laugh and move on. Sometimes, they’d share a laugh, and then the interviewer would ask him to answer seriously, which he did.

Whether you want to recycle the chocolate joke or not, it is a good idea to be prepared for all questions likely to be asked in an interview, including identifying your biggest weaknesses. When you’re discussing weaknesses, choose ones that are real, explain how you came to understand that you needed to get better, what you did to get better, and how that paid off. 

You want the interviewer to understand that you used to have that weakness but no longer do, but you can’t just say that as it is too conclusory. You want to convince them, and to do that, you need to take them on that little journey about how you came to realize you had a problem, how you fixed it, and how that’s been beneficial to your employers.

Steven Rothberg, Founder and Chief Visionary Officer, College Recruiter

 

Present Weaknesses with Actions Taken and Results

This is a question where some humility is expected, but it’s also a chance to showcase resilience. You don’t want to highlight a weakness that is essential to the job in question, so be mindful and cautious with what weakness you select and present to hiring managers.

Use this as an opportunity to share an actual instance of this weakness, with actions taken, and the results to demonstrate how you overcame that scenario. In doing so, you’ll demonstrate your commitment to self-improvement and to tackling tough situations.

Christopher Thoma, Head of Media, CareerAddict

 

Emphasize Team Role Awareness and Strengths Commitment

There is an argument that you’re never really going to become great at the things you’re not good at. And that, therefore, you should focus on becoming the best you can be at the things that come naturally to you and that you enjoy, or don’t mind doing. 

For example, if your brain wants to explode whenever you look at a spreadsheet, or you want to fall asleep whenever anyone starts talking conceptually, then there’s not much point in trying to mold or force yourself to be someone who works with numbers all day or has to work on conceptualizing as a primary function of their role. The best teams are the ones where each person knows what their strengths are and is okay with other people taking control of their gaps. 

A team will not work if everyone is trying to do everything. So, sharing this honesty with a potential employer shows that you have awareness of what strengths you can bring to the company, shows awareness and willingness that you are able to communicate and ask for help from other team members, and shows that you understand what you can commit to improving so that you can be the best at what you’re best at.

Hannah Ray, Life, Career + Business Coach, TAKE Coaching Amsterdam

 

Detail Specific Strategies for Addressing Growth Areas

To help your interviewer understand how you’re approaching a perceived weakness (or a growth area in general), share specific examples of strategies you’ve tried.

If time management is a challenge, you could list a few ways you’ve tried to restructure your schedule, build consistent habits, prioritize effectively, or project-manage your work. Explain what did and didn’t work for you (and if you have time, explain why).

In the end, try to tie it back to the job you’re interviewing for. Talk about how your new skills and insights will help your performance. Your interviewer isn’t expecting perfection—they want to know how you’re investing in yourself to be better at what you do.

Alex Lahmeyer, Founder, DEI Consultant, and Career Advisor, Boundless Arc

 

Embrace Vulnerability and Plans for Strength Conversion

Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable.

The truth is that candidates must first be aware of the fact that they have weaknesses to be able to give an honest answer to this question, much less one that showcases their commitment to self-improvement. Therefore, candidates just have to understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong with letting their vulnerability show at this point, because weaknesses are naturally part of our essence as human beings, so there is really no point in answering the weakness question with an intention to cloud your true weakness.

By far, one of the most effective ways that candidates can approach the weakness question and showcase honesty and commitment to self-improvement is to take a confessional mode and not be afraid to show their vulnerability. This is, however, not to say that they should sulk and dwell so much on the negatives of their weaknesses and fail to make mention of the plans they have for becoming better, but that they should not be afraid to share how their weaknesses have affected them in the past because this way, they demonstrate self-awareness that is committed to self-improvement.

Also, by embracing their weakness and having enough courage to be vulnerable during the job interview, they communicate their willingness to learn, grow, and convert this weakness into major strengths.

Tim Hastings, General manager, Top Rated Law

 

Provide Context to “Bad” Weaknesses with Solutions

It’s all about context. As an employer, I’d much rather hear a “really bad” weakness that has context rather than an artificial response. If someone lists “lazy” as their weakness, it sounds really bad, but if the context is, “After a long day of programming, I often feel too lazy to cook a full meal from scratch,” it’s definitely relatable. If “that’s why I like to do ingredient prepping on the weekend” is added, suddenly this makes the statement both relatable, honest, and solution-oriented.

Thomas Strobl, Founder, Fugoya

 

Utilize STAR Method to Outline Weakness and Improvement

The truth is that demonstrating competence and willingness to make improvements, even in the areas of their most profound weakness, will always work in the best interest of job candidates. 

One way that candidates can approach the weakness question in a way that showcases honesty and commitment to self-improvement is to approach the question using the STAR method. Because this method takes a four-part approach to questions, it affords candidates the opportunity to present a particular situation when their weakness threatened their efficiency in a workplace setting, the task that needed to be completed, the action that they took, and the result that was achieved.

What makes this an effective way to approach the weakness question is the fact that it allows candidates the opportunity to paint a vivid picture of the steps that they have taken to eliminate the limiting and self-stagnating effects of their weakness. 

By selecting a particular instance when their weakness challenged their ability to achieve a desired result, and strongly emphasizing the actions that were taken to mitigate this weakness, and then going on to highlight the results of these mitigative actions, candidates would be successful at marketing themselves as competent, while also showcasing honesty and commitment to self-improvement.

Andrew Johnson, General Manager, National Drug Helpline

 

Combine Candid Feedback and Self-Awareness

I have always approached this sort of question with humor and a smile. “You mean, ‘Well, I probably work too hard?’” I then move on to some candid feedback and perspective. 

For example, “What some people consider a weakness, others may consider a strength. I have a hard time hiding my expressions when I am dealing with someone who is bogging down progress for the sake of wanting to look important. Some people would call that a positive—being candid—while others would call it undiplomatic.” 

I created a quirk list years ago. I’ve shared it with people when they join my team. There’s no reason to waste time, energy, and emotion trying to figure me out when I can give you the list. “Here I am. I’d be happy to share it with you.” That approach has always worked for me. If the interviewer doesn’t like that approach, then I probably shouldn’t be working there anyway.

12 Effective Ways to Research a Company Before an Interview | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/12-effective-ways-to-research-a-company-before-an-interview/,"12 Effective Ways to Research a Company Before an Interview

In preparation for your next job interview, we’ve gathered insights from top professionals, including HR executives and CEOs, to offer you the most effective strategies for researching a company. From analyzing employee social profiles to utilizing LinkedIn for company insights, explore the twelve comprehensive strategies these experts recommend for a deep dive into your potential employer’s world.

Analyze Employee Social Profiles
Observe Active Social Media Channels
Check Crunchbase for Financial History
Conduct Informational Interviews
Research Interviewers and Company Staff
Study the Company’s Digital Footprint
Review Website, Reports, and Employee Insights
Utilize Glassdoor for Candid Feedback
Leverage Official Channels and Employee Reviews
Read Between the Lines of Company Communications
Compare Company with Industry Competitors
Utilize LinkedIn for Company Insights

 

Analyze Employee Social Profiles

Drawing from my dual background as an HR professional with five years of experience and an HR writer with four years under my belt, I’ve developed a keen eye for assessing company cultures and work environments beyond the company’s LinkedIn page and traditional review sites like Glassdoor. 

A key strategy is to closely observe how employees discuss their work environment and culture on their personal LinkedIn profiles. This approach offers authentic insights into the company culture, beyond what is officially presented.

For instance, recurring mentions of overtime, burnout, or high stress levels among employees are clear red flags, indicating a potential culture of overwork. Conversely, posts celebrating team achievements, work-life balance, or professional development suggest a positive, supportive environment. Such nuances provide valuable, candid insights into the company’s real culture, guiding you toward making a well-informed decision about your potential workplace.

Maheen Kanwal, HR Executive, B2B Tech SaaS Copywriter, Founder, Call to Authority

 

Observe Active Social Media Channels

Assess the socials that they’re most active on so that you can really get a sense of what makes them ‘tick’, and what they’re likely to respond positively to. For example, if they have an office dog, then you can share your mutual love of dogs, or if they’re working on a certain project that they’ve shared, then you can comment on that project specifically.

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Check Crunchbase for Financial History

If you plan on working for a start-up, a scale-up, or a rapidly growing organization, I strongly recommend looking at Crunchbase to see their financial history. A great many privately owned companies survive almost entirely on venture capital, and the availability of this capital is paramount to their continued existence. 

Crunchbase outlines a company’s investment history, providing powerful insight into where the money is coming from. Consequently, when applying for jobs, it’s always worth keeping an eye on how much funding they have received, and for two reasons. Free-flowing funding means that salaries are likely to be paid as promised, as they are unlikely to run into financial problems in the short term. But also, if venture capital firms are interested in investing, this suggests the organization has something special going on, which is a positive sign.

Oliver Savill, CEO and Founder, AssessmentDay

 

Conduct Informational Interviews

One strategy I highly recommend for thoroughly researching a company before an interview is to leverage informational interviews with current or former employees. While online resources provide valuable information, speaking directly with individuals who have firsthand experience with the company can offer unique insights and perspectives.

Start by reaching out to your professional network or utilizing platforms like LinkedIn to identify individuals who currently work at or have previously worked for the company. Politely request a brief informational interview where you can ask questions about their experiences, company culture, values, and any other relevant aspects.

During the informational interview, focus on open-ended questions that encourage detailed responses. Inquire about the company’s mission, recent projects or initiatives, workplace environment, team dynamics, and growth opportunities. Additionally, ask about challenges they’ve faced and how the company addresses them, as well as any advice they have for potential candidates.

Listening attentively to their responses can provide valuable insights beyond what you might find in official company materials. Pay attention to recurring themes or sentiments, which can help you better understand the company’s culture and values.

After the informational interview, take notes and reflect on the information gathered. Compare it with other research sources, such as the company’s website, news articles, and employee reviews, to gain a comprehensive understanding.

Daniel Jorge, Senior Consultant, EC1 Partners

 

Research Interviewers and Company Staff

At the end of the day, companies are made up of people. It’s super important before an interview to do research about the people you’ll be speaking with. Just five minutes of Googling can do a lot… Look at their LinkedIn page (maybe you have connections or education in common) and find something interesting to discuss.

I’ve interviewed hundreds of people, and many don’t even look at our company website before speaking with us. Those that do just a little bit of research about the company and me really stand out and show they go the extra mile!

Corey Schwitz, CEO & Founder, On-Demand Salesforce, Hubspot and Revenue Ops Customization, Skydog Ops

 

Study the Company’s Digital Footprint

A unique strategy for researching a company thoroughly before an interview is to study its digital footprint beyond the traditional scope of its official website and social media profiles. This involves a deep dive into various online platforms and resources where the company’s indirect presence can provide insightful context about its culture, reputation, and operational nuances. Here’s how to approach this:

Participate in or review discussions on industry-specific forums and online communities related to the company’s field. These platforms can offer unfiltered insights into the company’s reputation within the industry, emerging challenges it might be facing, and the innovations it’s known for.

Websites like Trustpilot, Yelp, or even product review sections on e-commerce platforms can provide a wealth of information about the company’s products or services, customer satisfaction levels, and how the company handles complaints or feedback. This research can explain the company’s customer service ethos and product quality.

Companies in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, etc.) should check reports and filings with regulatory bodies. These documents can shed light on the company’s compliance history, financial health, and any regulatory challenges it may have faced. This information can be particularly insightful for understanding the company’s operational rigor and market standing.

Vaibhav Kakkar, CEO, Digital Web Solutions

 

Review Website, Reports, and Employee Insights

Before your interview, check the company’s website to learn about what it values and who leads it. Look at reports and financial statements for information on its finances and performance. Check news and social media for recent projects and how the company is perceived publicly. Read what employees say on sites like Glassdoor to understand how people feel about working there. 

Also, check LinkedIn for key people and connect with current or past employees if possible. This will give you a good understanding of the company, and during the interview, you can show that you know about its goals and values.

Eva Toledo, Senior Researcher, Kepler Search Pte Ltd

 

Utilize Glassdoor for Candid Feedback

I would highly recommend using Glassdoor or any other tool that will provide candid feedback about an organization. While organizations can pay to try to have bad reviews removed, the on-the-ground feedback and how an organization responds can show a lot.

In my consulting practice, I was burned by this previously. A client that I was going to work for had really bad reviews about the culture, the owner, and red flags that would have been a tip-off of things to come. However, I ignored the data in front of me. They turned out to be very much like the reviews, and I should have heeded the warnings. I ended up leaving the client after about six months.

Ben Madden, Owner, HR Action LLC

 

Leverage Official Channels and Employee Reviews

I highly recommend utilizing the company’s official channels, particularly its website and published materials. Start by reviewing the About Us, Mission Statement, and Values sections to grasp the organization’s foundational principles and culture. Examine annual reports and financial statements for insights into the company’s financial health and performance. 

Additionally, explore recent news articles, press releases, and social media profiles to understand current developments and employee interactions. Leveraging employee review platforms like Glassdoor can provide valuable perspectives on the work environment. Connecting with current or former employees on platforms like LinkedIn can offer firsthand insights. 

This comprehensive approach ensures that candidates not only understand the business’s objectives and financial standing but also its culture and employee experiences, facilitating a more informed and tailored interview preparation.

Steven Mostyn, Chief Human Resources Officer, Management.org

 

Read Between the Lines of Company Communications

The most important thing is to read between the lines on a company’s website and public communications to figure out what they really care about. Study their About page, press releases, leadership bios, and so on. Look for signs that they value innovation, people, or social responsibility in a way that appeals to you. Understanding what motivates a company will help the conversation flow better in interviews, beyond just your qualifications.

Additionally, check out news articles and reviews to get balanced inside perspectives from employees. Approach learning about a company as an interesting research project where no detail is too small. Doing this groundwork will allow you to assess if it’s a good fit, align values, and show how you can contribute.

I’ll admit I didn’t always do enough research early on and stumbled in interviews. But being your real self, focused on helping people more than profits, makes connections that the right organization will recognize.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-founder and CEO, EchoGlobal

 

Compare Company with Industry Competitors

One very effective tactic when researching the company you are about to interview with is not only studying the company’s history, products, services, and culture but also the company’s competitors to get a broader view of the industry and how the company stands against those competitors.

You can find company intelligence in industry reports, news articles, or in financial statements. This can help you to understand the competitive dynamics, current market trends, or present challenges. A good way to impress the interviewer can be to refer to their competitors and how they might be able to take account of this in the job you are applying for. It would show that you can think strategically and that you tend to be proactive.

An interviewer may ask you to describe some ways you might contribute to the company if you got hired. It’s a way of asking, “What can you do for us?” It can also be a way to determine your motivation and commitment to the company. Answering this question can help build your credibility and show the interviewer that you are excited to help the company grow. Some possible ways you might be able to contribute to the company that you’re interviewing for include bringing in new trends, being knowledgeable about the company, and being innovative.

Blake Smith, Marketing Manager, ClockOn

 

Utilize LinkedIn for Company Insights

LinkedIn provides a wealth of information about companies, including their mission, values, products or services, and recent news or updates. Additionally, you can explore the company’s culture page on LinkedIn, which often includes employee testimonials and insights into the work environment. 

Another valuable aspect of LinkedIn is the opportunity to leverage your professional network. If you know anyone, past or present, who has worked at the company, you can reach out to them for insights or information. 

Connecting with current or former employees can provide you with firsthand perspectives on the company’s culture, work environment, and overall experience. They may be able to share valuable insights that go beyond what you can find through public sources. This knowledge will help you prepare for your interview and demonstrate your genuine interest in the company.

The Importance of Authenticity: How to Be Yourself in an Interview | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/the-importance-of-authenticity-how-to-be-yourself-in-an-interview/,"The Importance of Authenticity: How to Be Yourself in an Interview

In search of the golden rule for staying true to oneself in the high-stakes environment of job interviews, we’ve gathered twenty insights from seasoned professionals, including coaches and CEOs. From embracing your unique story to the importance of being comfortable in your clothes, these tips will guide you to present your most authentic self. Discover the collective wisdom that can help you make a genuine impression.

Embrace Your Unique Story

When it comes to job interviews, don’t be afraid to embrace your uniqueness. You bring a blend of experiences, skills, and perspectives that no one else can. Remember, your individuality is your greatest asset, and only you can tell your story. Confidently and transparently share how your unique qualities will add value to the team.

After a long career in one profession, I decided I wanted to pivot in a completely different direction. It was important for me to reflect on what set me apart and how my skills aligned with the roles I pursued, even though the career path was very different. I was able to show up to interviews being true to myself while confidently sharing my unique narrative and how it complemented the organization I was hoping to join.

It’s not just about fitting into a role; it’s about showing how the role fits you.

Komita Liggans, ACC, Coach and Content Creator, GK Liggans

 

Highlight Your Personality via Storytelling 

As an experienced recruiter, my top tip for candidates aiming to maintain authenticity and be themselves during a job interview is to focus on storytelling.

Share real-life examples from your experiences, emphasizing challenges you’ve overcome and achievements you’re proud of. By weaving narratives into your responses, you not only provide concrete evidence of your skills but also allow your personality to shine through. Be genuine in your communication and ‌share the lessons you’ve learned from both successes and setbacks.

This approach not only showcases your professional capabilities but also ensures that the interviewer gets a true sense of who you are and what you bring to the table.

Hanna Borysenko, HR Director, Elai Inc.

 

Balance Professionalism With Authenticity

I know you can feel pressured to be super professional in an interview. And sure, an interview is definitely a performance where you need to bring your A-game. But it’s also important to be yourself. (Or at least bring the parts of your personality that you want to bring into your professional life.) Why? Because if you land this job, you’ll be doing it for 5 days a week, 8 hours a day (at least!). If you’re some fake version of yourself in a job interview, and they hire that version of you, now you have to keep showing up playing that character!

You can decide how authentic to be in an interview. But if there are parts of your personality that you need to express while working, it’s okay to show that in your interview. For me, that’s humor. If jokes aren’t welcome in your office, I don’t want to be there, either. So you can bet I’ll try to make a joke in an interview to see how that lands! So my tip? Start by giving yourself permission to be authentic.

Pat Fligge, Director of Temple Professional Network, Temple University

 

Make Connections Through Vulnerability

Sharing moments of vulnerability, when appropriate, such as discussing challenges you’ve faced and how you’ve overcome them, can help you feel more like yourself. When you discuss challenges you have faced in your past jobs, it can help you make more meaningful connections with those who are interviewing you. 

Always maintain professionalism and focus on the lessons learned and growth achieved through those experiences, and share this with them as well. It can show your determination and critical-thinking skills, which are helpful during an interview!

Renan Ferreira, Head of Communications and Director of Sales, RealCraft

 

Practice Authenticity, Dismiss Doubts

When under stress, it’s challenging to let our true personality shine through, which is particularly problematic during job interviews. Practice, however, makes perfect. The more interviews you participate in, the easier it becomes to be transparent. 

To prepare for showing your honest self, consider seeking a voice coach who specializes in “elevator pitches.” Rehearsing your answers to typical questions in the mirror, much like actors do, will boost your confidence. Nerves can also stem from “impostor syndrome,” the feeling of not being qualified for the position. It’s important to dismiss such doubts, build self-assurance, and concentrate on the reasons why you are the right fit for the job. 

If there is a skill you lack, be upfront about it and have a plan for how you will address this gap. Remember, interviewers have a challenging task, and a brief acknowledgment of your appreciation for the opportunity to meet can help to break the ice and make a positive initial impression.

Lilia Koss, Community Manager, Facialteam

 

Candidly Discuss Growth Areas

One tip for showing authenticity is by being candid about your limitations. It shows you have a realistic understanding of yourself and are ready to keep growing, which is highly valued in any professional environment. When discussing areas for improvement, I recommend framing them in learning and development. 

For example, if there’s a skill you might lack, mention how you’re actively and practically working on it. This approach will highlight your honesty and also a proactive attitude toward self-improvement. However, it’s important to balance this by also discussing your strengths and how they align with the job’s requirements. This demonstrates self-awareness and a strategic mindset, which prove that you’re both aware of your limitations and also focused on leveraging your strengths effectively.

Bayu Prihandito, Certified Psychology Expert, Life Coach, Founder, Life Architekture

 

Foster Genuine Connection with Self-Awareness

Focus on genuine self-awareness and honesty. Employers appreciate and respect authenticity and just want to get to know the real person behind the resume. 

If your career has evolved unconventionally, or you’ve had to take a career break for personal circumstances, be honest. Avoid giving rehearsed or overly polished answers; instead, speak from the heart. Use your own words, and let your personality shine through in your responses. 

By establishing a genuine connection with the interviewer and showing a genuine interest in the company and the role, you’ll leave the interview knowing that you have been true to yourself. If you are the right fit for the company, the employer will recognize it.

Katharine Gallagher, Founder, Personal and Professional Growth, katharinegallagher.com

 

Trust Your Intuition

Follow your intuition. Pay attention to your gut feelings about the job and the people interviewing you. If something doesn’t feel right, it may not be the right fit for you. Celebrate that self-awareness rather than turning it into a frustrating moment or feeling like you wasted time. Realize that each interaction is getting you closer to where you belong.

Kelli Anderson, Career Coach, Texas General Insurance

 

Avoid Guessing Interviewer’s Mind

The trick to authenticity in interviews is to avoid turning the interview into a Keynesian beauty contest.

A Keynesian beauty contest is a hypothetical beauty contest where judges are rewarded for choosing the most popular faces among other judges, not necessarily those they find most attractive. The economist John Maynard Keynes likens this situation to investors buying securities which they believe others will invest in, rather than securities that have intrinsic value.

Consequently, when an interviewee attempts to tell the interviewer “what they want to hear,” they are ignoring their authentic self and are simply trying to second-guess the interviewer’s criteria.

Instead, you should answer questions in a way that feels effective to you, not what you suspect may be effective to your interviewer. This way, you can focus 100% of your attention on providing good responses while staying true to who you are.

Ben Schwencke, Business Psychologist, Test Partnership

 

Assess Mutual Fit Honestly

During a job interview, consistently remind yourself that this is a mutual evaluation process. Recognize that the interview is not just about convincing the employer that you are the right addition to their team; it’s also about assessing whether the company and team align with your values and career goals. 

Throughout the interview process, focus on responding in the most genuine and truthful manner. Avoid the temptation to provide answers that you think the interviewer wants to hear. Instead, share your genuine experiences, skills, and perspectives that are relevant to the position. This will not only allow the interviewer to get a true sense of who you are and the value you bring to their team, but it will also help you determine if the role and company are right for you.

Heidi Hauver, Chief People Officer

 

Prepare for Natural Conversation

Being yourself is great for helping your interview manager recognize you as a person. However, it doesn’t equate to admitting that coming late is your routine; this is plainly an unprofessional attitude. Be authentic in your role and expertise so that it doesn’t put overwhelming pressure on you when you join the company. 

The key to being genuine with your manager is to avoid over-preparing for the interview. The massive storage of already prepared responses will push you away from exposing your inner being for work. Canned responses will put you at risk of responding like a robot. Prepare in general—for example, look for the questions but don’t memorize them. You will allow yourself to flow with the conversation.

Janice Hawkins, Group Sales and Marketing Manager, Future Care Group

 

Showcase Your Side Hustle

My tip is to highlight your “side hustle.” Discuss a personal project or entrepreneurial endeavor you’re passionate about outside of your main career. This not only showcases your authenticity but also your drive, creativity, and the ability to balance multiple commitments. It demonstrates that you’re a well-rounded professional with a genuine passion for your work, both inside and outside the traditional business sphere.

Josh Ladick, President, GSA Focus

 

Lead With Your Values

When preparing for an interview, it’s important to define your values. Often, there’s a focus on leaving a positive impression, which can lead to altering one’s personality unintentionally. Leading with your values helps maintain authenticity.

For instance, if collaboration is a key value, frame responses to highlight collective successes with coworkers or problem-solving with other stakeholders. Being conscious of your values allows them to naturally influence your answers.

This approach is also useful for formulating questions for the interviewer. For example, asking, “I’ve found that collaboration is important to me in a work environment. As a remote-first company, how do you use technology to foster collaboration?”

Alex Lahmeyer, Founder and DEI Consultant, Boundless Arc

 

Connect as Individuals

Avoid giving generic answers that could apply to anyone, because if you sound and act like everyone else, you will come across as phony. Instead, focus on connecting with the interviewer as a person and enjoy the process. Smile. Speak with your hands. Show that you are delighted when answering their questions because you are enjoying the conversation.

Jeff Altman, Global Job Search Coach, The Big Game Hunter, Inc.

 

Arrive Early, Stay Composed

My advice is to ensure that you arrive early, with enough time to calm down and rehearse the main points you want to cover.

There’s nothing worse than feeling prepared and then having to rush on your way to the interview, which can often lead to being flustered and making mistakes that you otherwise wouldn’t!

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Back Claims With Evidence

Be prepared to have examples to back up claims of previous achievements or previous work. This doesn’t mean an extensive history, but rather, if you’re claiming to have achieved “x” or “y,” then it does help to have some form of evidence to support your claims.

Wendy Makinson, HR Manager, Joloda Hydraroll

 

Stay Honest, Remain Calm

Research shows that recruiters decide whether they want to hire you within the first 90 seconds of an interview. Chances are, they won’t delve deeply enough into your resume to care about minor exaggerations. 

However, most people become nervous about their lies being caught while the recruiter scans their resume. You may be caught in a lie if the recruiter focuses on something you exaggerated and questions you about it. Remaining calm and casual is the key to acing an interview, and the recruiter will notice a change in your demeanor. 

You’re much better off being honest. If you’re afraid of inexperience, shift the focus of the interview to your strong qualities.

Perry Zheng, Founder and CEO, Pallas

 

Use Humor to Ease Tension

Flipping the script usually helps set a better tone than the standard interrogation. The best way to do this, in my experience, is to acknowledge the awkwardness to the interviewers. 

I’ve had a potential hire crack a joke, starting with “I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve brought you all here today…” before explaining that he just wanted to clear the air a bit so we could all talk more normally. This was extremely impressive and very effective in managing a stressful situation, so I recommend this approach to others.

Dragos Badea, CEO, Yarooms

 

Take the Pressure Off Interviews

It sounds bad if I tell you not to take it too seriously, but—I would say that’s the number one thing that takes the pressure off. The best way to subvert the importance of an interview is to try to get another one. It’s like dating—if you’re only setting one date with one person, there’s too much riding on it. You want options, to take the edge off.

Do the same with job interviews—if you know there are options and alternatives waiting for you, you can afford to be more relaxed, more yourself. And ironically, you will perform much better when it’s not that serious.

Rick Berres, Owner, Honey-Doers

 

Be Comfortable in Your Clothes

One aspect that I think a lot of people don’t consider is being comfortable in your clothes. By this, I naturally don’t mean that you should show up to the interview in your pajamas; instead, you should wear your interview clothes for a few days ahead of time. 

Unless you’re regularly wearing a suit or formal wear, you’re going to be uncomfortable, and your body language will not be the same as usual. This does come through to the astute interviewer, so being comfortable in your formal wear is a great way to help you be yourself.

Onno Halsema, CEO, Contentoo

Utilize AI for Personalized Video Messages

I use Maverick AI to send personalized video messages. I record a use case (I have several different ones for business development and one thanking for joining my talent community) video. Then, I give a quick recap of my most relevant experience and address any action items or any skills (software) I may not have had or weren’t strong with after having learned them. 

I let them know I’ve taken the initiative to bridge the skill gap and list what all I have learned to do and how to do those things. Video leaves an impression. The AI will swap out the first name of whoever you are addressing in the video using your voice, so you can record once but still send to Bob, Steve, and Frank, and each will see the same video but at the very beginning you will say their name to add that personalized touch. You can send 1,000 video links out per month for as low as $50-$100.

Matthew Jones, Senior IT Recruiter, VIP Staffing

 

Record a Thank-You Video

Surprisingly, candidates don’t always follow up after an interview, so doing so can really help you stand out. To differentiate yourself, consider recording a thank-you video. A short, 2-3 minute video message can add a more personal touch to your thank you and make a memorable impression for a hiring team navigating a full inbox. 

In your video, you can share that you enjoyed the discussion, express your appreciation for the hiring team’s time, reinforce your understanding of the role by summarizing key discussion points, highlight aspects of the role that align with your interests, skills, and abilities, and take some time to explain how you plan to contribute to the success of the company. 

You can finish your message by sharing your genuine enthusiasm for the position and let the team know that you are looking forward to hearing from them on the next steps.

Heidi Hauver, Chief People Officer

 

Add Value with Prompt Email Follow-Up

In my experience of interviewing thousands of candidates, it has always impressed me when they follow up. 

However, the truth is that very few candidates follow up. Therefore, doing so will not only differentiate your application but also give the impression that you are highly motivated. Being a more memorable candidate is even more important if an employer has many choices and is struggling to decide.

Prompt follow-up by email is recommended. Express gratitude for the employer’s time, convey that it was a pleasure to meet them, and express your interest in the job. If the employer mentioned further assessments or meetings, reiterate that you’re keen to complete these at their earliest convenience.

Last, you may wish to add value like: “During our conversation, you mentioned [Challenge/Objective]. I’ve been thinking about it and wanted to share some thoughts on how I could contribute…”

Geoff Newman, Founder, Starget.co.uk

 

Create a Relevant Mini-Project

In a hyper-competitive talent research sphere, it’s not just skills that set you apart, but the nuances of your approach post-interview. 

One intriguing method would be to craft a bespoke mini-project or short analysis pertinent to a challenge mentioned during an interview faced by the prospective company. Rather than a traditional thank-you note, send a succinct presentation or document that demonstrates your proactive approach to problem-solving. This not only exhibits your initiative but offers a tangible glimpse of the value you’d bring.

Moreover, integrate feedback or insights from the interview into this project. This showcases your attention to detail, active listening skills, and eagerness to adapt, making you a memorable candidate in a sea of conventional follow-ups.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-Founder and CEO, EchoGlobal

 

Send a Personalized Book Recommendation

After my interview, I sent the interviewer a personalized book that resonated with our discussion, accompanied by a note explaining its relevance and how it reflected my perspective on the role. This thoughtful gesture not only underscored my commitment and passion but also provided a tangible representation of my values and approach, setting me apart as a candidate who goes the extra mile.

Rob Blum, CEO, Blumsafe

 

Provide Recruitment Process Feedback

If you’re determined to get a job after the interview, any respectable company would appreciate your feedback on the recruitment process. 

Sending your opinion about it might seem risky and controversial. However, we need to remember that modern companies’ values are based on the culture of feedback. Sharing your ideas proves your familiarity with the job market’s values. It will also present you as a confident and outspoken person, aware of their competencies. Make sure your language is professional, but avoid being too authoritative. Of course, you should consider such a move only if you have positive feelings about how you were approached as a candidate. 

In other words, balance your expertise with humility. Address various steps of the recruitment process to prove your engagement and dedication to it. Only some candidates summon up the courage to adopt this strategy, so you will undoubtedly set yourself apart from the competition.

Martyna Szcześniak, Community Expert, MyPerfectResume

 

Polish Interview Answers Post-Interview

Consider showcasing your dedication to ongoing growth and refinement to set yourself apart from other candidates. Specifically, revisit the questions that were asked during the interview and provide more polished answers after thoughtful consideration through a follow-up email. 

This approach not only underscores your genuine interest in the position but also highlights your ability to adapt and continually enhance yourself. Demonstrating your commitment to self-improvement and reflective thinking can make a lasting impression on the hiring team.

Trendy Tan, Marketing Senior, Kepler Search

 

Include Relevant Project in Follow-Up

Distinguishing yourself in your follow-up after a job interview all depends on the seeds you planted during the interview itself. During the interview, find the right time or steer the conversation towards a specific project you completed that showcases your skills and experience. 

During your email follow-up, you can include links or attach your project so that the interviewer can learn more. This will create a lasting impression as it provides direct evidence of your qualifications.

Adam Shlomi, Founder, SoFlo Tutors

 

Summarize the Interview in Follow-Up

One time, I actually received a summary of the interview, which kind of blew my mind as it was over an hour long and touched on quite a few subjects. The thank-you email basically summarized everything we discussed and even included some additional clarifications beyond what was said to shore up some points in their resume and experience. 

It clearly took quite a lot of work, not to mention a prodigious memory and set of communication skills, so it really stuck in my mind.

Dragos Badea, CEO, Yarooms

 

Send a Handwritten Thank-You Note

One unique way to make a lasting impression post-interview is by sending a handwritten thank-you note. It showcases gratitude and illustrates your dedication and the extra effort you’re willing to put in. 

While it might seem old-fashioned, such a gesture stands out precisely because of its rarity. Receiving a physical note in an age of digital communication can leave a significant impact, making you memorable in the eyes of the interviewer. This personal touch can set you apart from other candidates and demonstrate your genuine interest in the position.

Michael Sena, CEO and Lead Analytics Consultant, Senacea Ltd.

 

Share a Relevant Article Post-Interview

One creative or unique idea for following up after a job interview is to find an article that relates to something that was talked about in the interview. 

The next step could be to send a note that says something along the lines of: “I came across an article today that reminded me of the discussion we had around X. I’d love to know your thoughts.” 

This approach is a great way to stay top-of-mind, provide something of value to the interviewee, and to follow up without the typical “I wanted to follow up” email.

John Mooney, President, IML

What Questions Should I Ask a Product Owner in an Interview? | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/what-questions-should-i-ask-a-product-owner-in-an-interview/,"From checking for Scrum experience to understanding how they overcome challenges, here are 11 answers to the questions, “What are a few effective questions to ask a product owner in an interview, and why?”

 

Do You Have Experience Working With a Scrum Framework?
What is Important About Research and Validation?
How Do You Measure the Success of Your Product…?
Who Is the Most Significant Product Stakeholder?
How Do You Prioritize Product Backlog?
How Do You Stay Up-to-Date on Industry Trends and…
How Can You Avoid Being a Bottleneck for a Scrum Team?
What Do You Think About Our Current Product?
How Do You Balance Trade-offs Between Key Stakeholders?
Can You Define the Product Owner Role?
Describe a Challenge You’ve Had With an Executive 

 

Do You Have Experience Working With a Scrum Framework?

In my experience as an interviewer for product owners, I always find one question particularly telling: “Do you have experience working with a Scrum framework?” As Agile methodology and Scrum become increasingly popular in working environments, being able to work within the Scrum framework is essential for being an effective product owner. 

The answer to this question can provide insight into both their technical aptitude and focus on results: people with a background in Scrum are well-organized, relentless goal-setters capable of foreseeing potential outcomes. Of course, there are other questions that can help determine if the candidate is suited to be a product owner, but this one is definitely one of the most important.

Antreas Koutis, Administrative Manager, Financer

 

What Is Important About Research and Validation?

As a product owner myself, I like to ensure that my team members clearly understand the importance of research and validation. One question I like to ask is, “What is the most important thing to remember about research and validation?” This question pushes the candidate to reflect on their own experience and gives me insight into their experience in a role that I value highly.

Matthew Ramirez, CEO, Rephrasely

 

How Do You Measure the Success of Your Product…?

When interviewing a product owner, one question I always ask is, “How do you measure the success of your product, and what metrics do you use?” 

This question allows you to understand their product management approach and gives insight into how they measure success. It helps you evaluate if they have the knowledge and experience to be a good fit for your company and gives you insight into whether they are using the right KPIs, as well as their ability to analyze and interpret the data. 

If possible, I like to get specific answers from candidates on what metrics they use, how often they track these metrics, and what actions they take based on them. If a candidate can’t provide specifics about their process, then this is a red flag that something may be wrong with their product management approach.

Shaun Connell, Founder, Writing Tips Institute

 

Who Is the Most Significant Product Stakeholder?

In an interview with a potential product owner, it is important to ask questions to assess their understanding of the role and ability to manage complex projects. One effective question that can help evaluate the candidate’s product management capacity is, “Who do you believe is the most significant product stakeholder‌?” 

This question will provide insight into how the prospective product owner perceives stakeholders and their involvement in product development. Not only will this answer provide valuable information about their technical and managerial skills, but it can also reveal key traits, such as adaptability and resourcefulness in managing different stakeholders.

Jim Campbell, Owner, Camp Media

 

How Do You Prioritize Product Backlog?

One of the major challenges of every product owner is backlog prioritization. Customer, stakeholder, and team feature requests, as well as various bugs, can pile up quickly. Having a clear picture of the situation and the ability to prioritize accordingly is a key responsibility of a good product owner. 

A great product owner can show that they have complete control over the backlog, as well as the confidence to make hard decisions and say no to stakeholders when needed. They should also be able to choose or change how they track the product backlog to ensure the maximum productivity of their team.

Gordana Sretenovic, Co-Founder, Workello

 

How Do You Stay Up-to-Date on Industry Trends and…

“How do you stay up-to-date on industry trends and market changes, and how do you incorporate this knowledge into your product strategy?” Since staying informed about industry trends and market changes is crucial for success as a product owner, this question is worth asking during the interview. 

By understanding how a candidate stays updated and incorporates this knowledge into their strategy, you can gauge their ability to keep the product relevant and competitive in a rapidly changing market. 

This question also sheds light on how the person approaches market research and their capacity for compiling and analyzing data. It shows their ability to recognize and address market opportunities and difficulties, which are crucial components of the product owner’s job. By asking it, you test a candidate’s ability to stay ahead of the curve and make accurate decisions that drive the product’s success.

Nina Paczka, Community Manager, Resume Now

 

How Can You Avoid Being a Bottleneck for a Scrum Team?

I would ask: “As a product owner, how can you avoid being a bottleneck for a Scrum team?”

This question reveals a candidate’s ability to prioritize and focus on activities with the greatest impact on the product’s success, effectively manage their backlog, communicate with the team, foster a shared vision among team members, decide promptly, and understand how to handle dependencies.

Maryna Kucherova, Head of Product and Advisor, Elai.io

 

What Do You Think About Our Current Product?

There are many outstanding questions to ask during an interview. However, I believe this is the most important one: “What do you think about our current product? Why?”

It will have you find out if they even checked it out, did their research, and how they feel about it. If they have not checked out your product, that would be a no-go for me. It will give you great insights into their thoughts and where you could improve if they did. 

It makes the question relevant to your product, dives into the willingness of the person wanting the job, and gives insight into what kind of value they can bring. You can dive deeper with questions like:

 Can you explain our target market and user needs for our current product?
 How would you measure the success of our product and track its performance over time? 

If you keep things relevant to your product, it might give you some new insights. Especially when you do more interviews, it will provide you with new ideas.

Joran Hofman, Founder, Reditus

 

How Do You Balance Trade-offs Between Key Stakeholders?

“Can you describe a time when you had to make a difficult trade-off between the needs of different stakeholders in a product development project, and how you resolved the situation?” 

This question can reveal the candidate’s problem-solving skills, decision-making ability, and experience in managing stakeholder expectations, which are all important qualities for a product owner. 

A good product owner needs to balance the interests of various stakeholders, such as customers, management, development teams, and business partners, to ensure that the product meets the needs of the target market while staying within the constraints of the project. 

By sharing a specific example, the candidate can show their ability to handle complex situations, communicate effectively, and find creative solutions to overcome obstacles.

Luciano Colos, Founder and CEO, PitchGrade

 

Can You Define the Product Owner Role?

How an applicant answers this question will say a lot about their knowledge and exposure to the interviewer. Product owners are primarily responsible for the maximization of the value of their product, so that should be a significant factor in their answer. They also prioritize and organize the team’s work, backlog, and act as a proxy for customers.

Alexandre Robicquet, Co-Founder and CEO, Crossing Minds

 

Describe a Challenge You’ve Had With an Executive 

A significant question to ask a product owner in an interview is, “Describe a challenge you’ve had with an executive and how did you overcome the problem?” 

This allows the candidate to think about their experience and the challenges they have faced in their past roles, which can give the interviewer a better idea of how the candidate will handle similar challenges if hired. 

Additionally, it can also reveal how creative and resourceful the candidate is in working through problems, especially with senior leadership in the organization.

Top 12 Summer Jobs for Teens in 2022 | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/top-12-summer-jobs-for-teens-in-2022/,"What is a good summer job for teens who are planning on attending college in the fall?


To help recent high-school graduates find good summer jobs, we asked recruiters and career coaches this question for their best recommendations. From restaurant jobs to running a produce stand to finding a job in your future industry, there are several summer jobs that may help college-bound teens earn some money, gain valuable exposure and acquire some transferable skills that will serve them well in the future.


Here are 12 summer jobs for college-bound teens in 2022:
Restaurant Jobs 
Valet
Social Media Editor
Landscaping
Retail Jobs
Summer Camp Counselor
Babysitting
Run a Produce Stand
Dog Walking
Recreation Center Jobs
Realty Office Assistant
A Job in Your Future Industry

 

 

Restaurant Jobs 

Working at a restaurant is a great summer job for a college-bound student. Summer is a busy time for dining, so tips stack up quickly. The personal interactions of a restaurant also provide important socialization skills for young adults. Because a restaurant often has a young and energetic staff, there is a great opportunity to make new friends and work in a fast-paced environment. On the other hand, learning to deal with difficult managers, coworkers, or customers will provide vital lessons in how to practice patience, humility, and handle conflict.

dan potter, CRAFTD

 

Valet

Rising college students should consider being a valet for the summer. Valets are usually a role associated with the service and hospitality industry. Being a valet does not mean that the student has to be interested in a service or hospitality career. However, it is a great role to gain some experience in the short term. Hospitality jobs often require knowledge of customer service which is valuable information in essentially every industry. Knowing interpersonal skills and how to interact with customers will be useful to students in their future careers. Valet is one of the roles in the hospitality industry that offers major opportunities for young people to make connections as they interact with important customers from a variety of industries. Rising college students should consider being a valet for their summer job.

Liza Kirsh, DYMAPAK

 

Social Media Editor

Teens should consider becoming social media editors for some small businesses in their community. For example, a popular local restaurant will benefit from a digital marketing strategy or a boutique downtown. The younger generations have extensive knowledge of successful digital platforms and what content works for each. They can use this opportunity as a first step into the professional world before they attend college in the fall.

Sara Adam Slywka, Nestig

 

Landscaping

One good job for a teenager who will be collegebound in the fall is a landscaper. Landscaping is very steady work and easy to be trained on. Additionally, landscapers work seasonally, and coming back on breaks from college can be an easy arrangement. Working outside all day and getting some fresh air is a perk in and of itself too.

Kevin Callahan, Flatline Van Co.

 

Retail Jobs

Work in retail to gain organization and financial skills. Stores have to be cleaned to the best of their ability and clothes folded neatly so it’s presentable. In addition to cleanliness, sales associates are responsible for handling money at the cash register, which can help them with logistics and finances when they’re on their own. These skills are the initial building blocks for college students to survive on their own.

Jodi Neuhauser, Ovaterra

 

Summer Camp Counselor

College-bound teenagers make great summer camp counselors. Mentoring even younger minds at camp is a great chance to foster and educate the next generation of citizens and leaders before a teenager ventures off to college. This perspective will help stabilize them as they transition into adulthood and look to their older peers for guidance. Staffing a summer camp is a wonderful way to practice leadership, celebrate youth, and make some money while you’re at it.

Thomas Yuan, Sanebox

 

Babysitting

A great summer job for teens planning on going to college is babysitting. While many think of it as a once-in-a-while type of job, an enterprising teen can make babysitting a full-time job before they go off to school. They would need to do some marketing on social media and flyers, and they would need to keep a calendar for babysitting appointments and obligations. However, a teen that takes on this job that way can earn thousands in summer from parents who work and need daytime child care, along with those who want an evening out.

Bruce Tasios, Tasios Orthodontics

 

Run a Produce Stand

Teens who want to go to college can test their entrepreneurial skills with a produce stand or pop-up shop. This involves getting produce, flowers, and other items from local farmers or craftsmen but these products sell well in the summer. These shops close up in the fall, so it would be a good fit. A small stand would give teens a chance to run a shop without a lot of extra expense. It could generate enough revenue to pay for college as well. Some teens have done it every summer for years, earning enough to pay entirely for their college tuition.

Michael Gorlovsky, Windermere Orthodontics

 

Dog Walking

A great summer job for teens who want to go to college is being a dog walker. It’s easy and a good option for teens who love animals and like being outside. It is also good for those who don’t yet have a car because they can focus on neighbors with dogs in their neighborhood. Those who can walk several dogs at a time can make good money. It will also give them a chance to do something that benefits their neighbors and get to know others in their neighborhood.

Fadi Swaida, Halton Village Dental

 

Recreation Center Jobs

Working at a rec center is a great low-stress summer job for teens planning to attend college in the fall. The money isn’t spectacular, but a rec center provides a good opportunity to save a bit of money for an upcoming higher education endeavor. Additionally, there are multiple positions to choose from at a recreation center, including a lifeguard, front desk receptionist, gym manager, or game room attendant.

Ray Leon, Pet Insurance Review

 

Realty Office Assistant

Realty offices can offer a good summer opportunity for students who plan on attending college in the fall. Realty offices are often in need of assistants who can help with daily operations. These positions tend not to require outside training, but they can provide a great experience in regards to an office environment and interpersonal skills. Rising college students may even be able to assist in showing listings to potential clients. Students can leave this role come fall and feel confident in knowing that they have developed a number of professional skills.

Katy Carrigan, Goody

 

A Job in Your Future Industry

Find a summer job in the industry that you will want to enter after your college life has ended. Seek a job that can give you hands-on knowledge and experience that will benefit you down the road. If you have aspirations of working in the social media industry, find any internship that offers you vital insights into the inner workings of those platforms. If law, medicine or finance is your calling, go to any law firm, hospital or investment group that is hiring seasonal workers or interns. Reach out to school counselors, professors, teachers, or anyone else who can help you get your foot in the door. Be on the prowl for jobs that teach you the nuts and bolts of the field you aspire to enter.

Make a Lasting Impression: 11 Internship Interview Tips | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/make-a-lasting-impression-11-internship-interview-tips/,"What is one way a candidate can make a lasting impression during an internship interview? 

To help internship candidates make a lasting impression during an interview, we asked hiring managers and business leaders this question for their best advice. From following and referencing the company’s social media to being confident, there are several ways you can leave your internship interview on a high note and make a lasting impression.

 

Here are 11 interview tips to make a lasting impression:

Follow and Reference the Company’s Social Media
Look Up Your Interviewers
Be Prepared
Show Genuine Interest
Bring Energy With a Smile
Ask Questions
Be the Consummate Team Player
Practice Body Language
Show Off Your Potential With Real Examples
Use the STAR Interview Response Technique
Be Confident

 

 
Follow and Reference the Company’s Social Media

One way to make an impression during an interview is to follow the company on social media at the time you apply for the role, or even before you send in your application. This tactic provides a passive way to do research, as you can follow company updates and insights effortlessly while scrolling your feeds. Mentioning these posts and identifying yourself as a follower within the meeting gives the impression that you are generally interested in company affairs and plan to continue to pay attention to organizational happenings rather than merely cramming research solely for the interview. Of course, you should also still do focused and deeper research to complement more casual social media listening.

Michael Alexis, TeamBuilding

 

Look Up Your Interviewers

When you are getting ready for an interview, you should always look to see any information you can find on those conducting your interview. This can help you find specific questions to ask near the end of the interview that can show your initiative to learn as well as how invested you already are in the organization. It can reveal a lot about a candidate’s willingness to learn and become a great fit within the company!

Brandon Brown, Grin

 

Be Prepared

If you want to make a lasting impression during an internship interview, make sure to come prepared. Learn about the company, their values and conduct some research on your interviewers. This will be a good exercise for you to see if this would be a good fit for you.  It’s important to dress professionally in something that makes you feel comfortable but also a fit for the company’s environment. . Get plenty of rest before the interview and don’t be afraid to talk about your areas that interest you most (in line with the job description of course!) and where your weaknesses lie and steps you take to improve them. Finally, be yourself as authenticity is essential during an interview.

Sara Shah, Journ

 

Show Genuine Interest

A candidate can make a lasting impression during an internship interview by being prepared and showing genuine interest in the company and the position. By asking thoughtful questions and expressing enthusiasm for the opportunity, a candidate can leave a positive impression that may lead to an offer.

Matthew Ramirez, Rephrasely

 

Bring Energy With a Smile

Many candidates get nervous during their interview, which leads to a stiff or formal feeling. If you want to leave a lasting impression during an internship interview, make sure you bring lots of energy. The easiest way to do that is to make sure you smile. Don’t overdo it by smiling the entire time, but smile as you introduce yourself, as you talk about things that excite you, and as you conclude. It doesn’t take much to stand out – a smile can make all the difference.

Logan Mallory, Motivosity

 

Ask Questions

One way to make a lasting impression during an internship interview is to be prepared and ask questions. When meeting with potential employers, come equipped with questions about the company and the role you’re interviewing for. Not only will this show that you’re interested in the position, but it will also help you get a better understanding of what the company is looking for in a candidate. Demonstrating that you’ve done your research on the organization will leave a positive impression on your interviewer.

Claire Westbrook, LSAT Prep Hero

 

Be the Consummate Team Player

My best advice to make an impression on people during an internship interview is to position yourself as the ultimate team player. The greatest responsibility of interns is to support full-time employees and learn from them. Generally speaking, interns won’t be tasked with important, regular duties. What companies want to see is collaboration, support and a willingness to jump in and help out from their interns. So give them just that during the interview! When asked about your strengths or the value you would bring, discuss how whenever an opportunity presents itself to jump in and help out, you take it, even if you don’t know what you’re doing. I can say from experience that all of the intern candidates who have ultimately secured jobs with us all showed during the interview process how they weren’t afraid to go the extra mile. Pitching in and helping out others is what gets you remembered.

John Ross, Test Prep Insight

 

Practice Body Language

Interviewers will evaluate you, and your body language is a huge indication of your character whether you intend to or not. The way you carry yourself through your body is telling of your work ethic, professionalism, and confidence. Slouching or having a closed-off posture will make you seem unapproachable to your interviewer. On the other hand, standing or sitting tall with your arms and legs uncrossed will make you look confident and friendly, making a stronger impression on the interviewer.

Joe Spector, Dutch

 

Show Off Your Potential With Real Examples

As an internship seeker, you need to show the interviewer your potential for the specific role applied. Interviewers want to know how you will bring solutions to the company’s problems, so give them that hope. Ask questions highlighting your eagerness to learn. Use examples of your unique problem-solving strategies and come armed with result-driven answers for any interview question that gets thrown your way.  Remember, personality, education, and experience are not everything during an interview but showing off your potential of helping grow a company makes a lasting impression.

John Tian, Mobitrix

 

Use the STAR Interview Response Technique

STAR is an acronym for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. That is whereby, in response to behavioral interview questions, you answer by describing a situation in which you were involved, your task or responsibility, the actions you took, and the final results. To interviewers looking for proof of your abilities and skills to determine if you are a worthy addition to their team, the STAR interview technique helps you craft concise answers and share your accomplishments without sounding boastful. You may have skills on paper and an excellent presentation that go a long way in convincing any panel, but those don’t impress people as much as story-telling. To make a lasting impression, take advantage of the STAR interview method.

Ryan Yount, Luckluckgo

 

Be Confident

Be confident, yet humble. Employers are looking for employees who know their worth and abilities, but are willing to learn and be honest in regards to what they don’t know. If you want to make a first impression, be honest about what you know you are good at, but humble about your shortcomings.

Russell Lieberman, Altan Insights

Prepare for Spring Internship Applications: 12 Steps to Take | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/prepare-for-spring-internship-applications-12-steps-to-take/,"What is one step to take when preparing to apply for Spring internships?

To help you prepare for Spring internship applications, we asked business owners and career coaches this question for their best advice. From starting the process early to sending handwritten thank you notes, there are several steps you can take to best prepare you for the Spring internship season. 


Here are 12 steps to prepare for Spring internship applications:



Start the Process Early
Generate an Internship List
Build Your Network
Social Media Audit
Research the Company
Refresh Crucial Skills
Ask Questions in Advance
Brush Up On Your Interviewing Skills
Have Every Unique Experience Ready to Share
Use Your School’s Career Services Department
Prepare for Rejection
Standout With a Handwritten Thank You Note

 

 

Start the Process Early

Start early. The sooner you start preparing, the better. Make a list of companies you’re interested in, research their interview processes, and start putting together your application materials. Most companies begin the hiring process in January and February for Spring internships, so the time to apply is as soon as possible.

Claire Westbrook, LSAT Prep Hero

 

Generate an Internship List

Prepare your list of internships early. Figure out what creative project or video interview you are going to need to do to stand out from the crowd early and get prepared now. Have a list of 5-10 internships and have a unique preparation for each one. It is a lot of work, but the reward is worth it.

Michael Jankie, Natural Patch

 

Build Your Network

One step to take when applying for spring internships is to build out your network. A great way to do that is through Linkedin, and if you don’t have an account there I highly recommend you make one. The best way to find the most relevant people for you to connect with is through the job search tool. You can add in what industry you’re most interested in and it will give you a list of places hiring that are most relevant. Once you have looked through and found some appealing opportunities, I would then go through the people that work at the company and filter by which university you attend or attended. Alumni from your school are almost always willing to talk to aspiring professionals in their field. You can then send a quick message asking if they’d have time for an informational interview where they’ll explain their position and you are able to ask questions. This is a great way to show interest while also building out your network.

Gregg Dean, Layla Sleep

 

Audit Your Social Media

One important step to take when preparing to apply for Spring internships is to do a social media sweep and tidy up your online presence. Even if you are conservative in your online posting, other users might tag you in material that might reflect poorly with recruiters. Best to update your privacy settings to make it so that you must review and accept any tagged content before it is associated with your account, and to do a search to ensure that there is no incriminating material on your current profile.

Michael Alexis, TeamBuilding

 

Research the Company

One of the best practices when preparing for an internship interview is to look through the company’s website and research them as much as possible. Look into the products/services provided, the company’s values, leadership, etc. This will show your commitment to landing the role during the interview process. Being prepared will also let you anticipate the kinds of questions you’ll be asked ahead of time.

Bill Lyons, Griffin Funding

 

Refresh Crucial Skills

Hard skills are crucial for prospective interns as their experience rarely differentiates them. Being able to stand out with software abilities can make a difference. Using time to fill the knowledge gaps and obtain certificates will strengthen your applicant position. It will also make your career more meaningful as you will likely get to work with programs you know sooner.

Michael Sena, SENACEA

 

Ask Questions in Advance

It helps to attend a networking event regularly. Those events are a great way to also find out about internships. Ask questions. This will help you determine which internship is best for you. It’s always a good idea to plan for an unpaid internship. Maybe you can save some money in advance as well.

Shaun Price, MitoQ

 

Brush Up On Your Interviewing Skills

I always advise students to brush up on their interviewing skills by taking part in mock interview sessions. This can usually be scheduled at your university’s career services center, in which you can practice interviewing and receive immediate feedback on areas to improve upon. Many students seem to forget that these services exist, and they can really give you a leg up in the competition when you’ve practiced with a few mock interviews.

Kristine Thorndyke, Test Prep Nerds

 

Have Every Unique Experience Ready to Share

When you’re applying for Spring internships, you’ll typically be up against a lot of competition. That’s why it’s not just important to include the unique aspects of your experiences, but to actually showcase them. What will set you apart from everyone? Whether it be your volunteer work or specialized courses you’ve excelled at, be sure to include everything that can prove you’re a good fit for the internship.

Lindsay McCormick, Bite

 

Use Your School’s Career Services Department

If you are in college, you can use your career services department to assist you with finding a Spring Internship. Depending upon your major they can probably connect you with relevant internships. While you can look for internships on your own, it does not hurt to seek help as well, just in case.

Drew Sherman, RPM

 

Prepare for Rejection

It’s important to prepare for rejection when applying for Spring internships. While applying to internships is a fun and exciting time, there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive the only internship you applied for. Consider sending in resumes for several opportunities, and use potential rejections as motivation. Don’t take personal offense to these rejections. Everyone will find their own path and it will always work out the way it’s supposed to.

Corey Ashton Walters, Here

 

Standout With a Handwritten Thank You Note

After your interview, send a handwritten thank you note to each person who interviewed you. In the note, express your gratitude for their time and reiterate your interest in the position.

Employers often receive dozens (if not hundreds) of applications for a single position, so standing out from the crowd can be tough. Sending a handwritten note is one way to show that you’re truly interested in the internship and went above and beyond to make an impression.

Best 3 Questions to Ask an Interviewer for an Internship | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/questions-to-ask-interviewer-for-internship/,"You want to impress your interviewer from start to finish. This means that, in addition to preparing to answer the interviewer’s questions, you should be prepared to ask follow-up questions of your own.

This is an opportunity to get a sense of the company and understand specific details about the internship. Plus, asking thoughtful questions allows you to communicate your interest in the role.

If you need guidance, you’re in the right place. We have rounded up three outstanding questions to ask an interviewer for an internship interview. Keep it here to learn more and nail that internship interview!

Questions to Ask During an Internship Interview

One-sided interviews are awkward and uncomfortable — most times feeling like an interrogation rather than a conversation. As such, most interviewers will allow time for you to ask questions. The expectation is that you’ll ask questions — not only does this allow for greater knowledge acquisition, but it also implies that you are engaged in the hiring process.

With that said, learn what questions to ask an interviewer for an internship interview.

Question 1: Can you describe some of the challenges of this role?

Great accomplishments are not without struggle. A well-marketed internship position will highlight the incredible opportunities available; however, it may not also mention the unique challenges you may encounter. Ask the interviewer to highlight some of the difficulties that you might encounter during the internship.

This question will inform you about the position’s unique quirks. With this information, you can brainstorm ways to overcome challenges and skills you need to acquire before starting the position. Likewise, it may help you determine if the position is a good fit.

Question 2: Do you conduct any formal training for interns?

Since an internship’s primary objective is to promote professional development, it is critical to know how the company intends to do so. Find out how previous company internship programs have been conducted, and ask whether there are opportunities for mentorship and professional development.

This question demonstrates your interest in developing your professional skills, which employers are eager to see in a candidate. Another benefit of asking this question is improved clarity about internship opportunities. If skill growth is a top priority and the company offers resources for you to do so, then you know you’ve found a good fit.

Question 3: What projects will I be working on during the internship?

The job description provides some insight into the role, but it’s beneficial to learn about day-to-day responsibilities for clarity and further internship assessment.

If the day-to-day tasks are unrelated to your professional goals, this might not be the right internship to pursue. If, on the other hand, the work excites and seems like it will challenge you, the internship is one worth pursuing.

Tips on Asking Great Questions During an Internship Interview

Asking questions is an art that you must master to stand out among other candidates. The following tips will help you craft amazing questions that will lead to a meaningful discussion during the interview.

Tip 1: Practice Asking Questions

Practicing for the interview is an absolute must, and this extends beyond practicing your responses to questions. If you want to exude confidence in asking questions, practice beforehand. Contact a friend or a relative and simulate an interview question where you will practice asking questions.

Tip 2: Use State-of-the-Art Interview Preparation Tools

Practicing with a friend or family member can be helpful. But to truly set yourself up for success, you’ll need a one-of-a-kind system. InterviewFocus is a highly effective interview preparation platform that allows you to improve your tone, responses, eye contact level and more. Also, you can receive assistance from certified career coaches through the platform. This practice will equip you with key interview skills needed to keep the conversation going.

Tip 3: Open a Conversation

When it comes time to ask the hiring manager questions, ask the right kind of questions. What does this mean? Rather than asking a yes or no question, ask open-ended questions to invite the interviewer to begin a meaningful discussion. This way, you will get comprehensive feedback, enabling you to gather valuable information about the company and the opportunity at hand.

Wow Your Interviewer with Help from InterviewFocus

Asking the right questions is only one part of a successful interview. From your clothing to your tone of voice and posture, many factors play into how the interviewer perceives you. While this can feel overwhelming, it does not have to be.

Professional growth is within reach. If your interview skills could use some work, InterviewFocus is here to help.

*Not Boring* Questions to Ask in an Internship Interview | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/questions-to-ask-in-an-internship-interview/,"A polished resume and clean-cut interview outfit can only take you so far. To land the internship, you need to confidently navigate the conversation and stand out. One way to do so is to ask questions that other applicants won’t.

Cookie-cutter questions will have the interviewer glancing at the clock. Instead, show that you’re engaged and passionate about the role. For unique and memorable questions to ask in an internship interview, read below.

7 Questions To Ask That Won’t Put The Interviewer to Sleep

1. What is the culture of the [marketing] department like at this company?

Substitute For: How would you describe the company culture?

Great questions to ask in an internship interview allow you to stand out while getting useful information about the company. Since company culture has a large influence on how you’ll mesh (or clash) with coworkers, it’s important to ask about it.

However, the company culture question has become cliche. Chances are, the interviewer has answered it a hundred times. So, take a unique approach by getting specific about the culture in the department you’ll be a part of. Other unique company culture questions include:

How does the culture of [company] today compare to the culture five to ten years ago?
What is one thing you would change about the company culture?
2. What is it about this company that led you to work here, and how have you been able to grow?

Substitute For: What do you enjoy about working at this company?

When coming up with questions to ask in an internship interview, include a few that focus on the interviewer. Building rapport is a great way to earn brownie points with the interviewer. By showing interest in the other person, you may unlock information that other candidates don’t.

For example, asking about the interviewer’s career path allows you to see what type of people do well at the company. Also, following up to learn about career growth helps you envision what the company can offer in terms of long term success.

3. What does a typical work week in this role look like?

Substitute For: What does a typical day in this role look like?

When you ask about a day in the life, you might get a generic response. Even if the interviewer provides a more substantial response, you’ll only be learning about a sliver of the workweek.

Asking about the job in a broader timeframe helps you get a complete picture of the role. Maybe you’ll meet with your team lead on Mondays. Maybe there are weekly inter-department brainstorming sessions every Wednesday. Show the interviewer that you think beyond the day to day with a question like this.

4. What are some of the challenges that an intern will face in this role?

Substitute For: Do you have any advice for an intern entering this role?

Employers value employees that can problem solve. Make it clear that you’re up for the challenge and don’t expect the internship to be a walk in the park. If possible, tie a company value into the question. For instance, “I know that teamwork is a core value at [company name]. What are some of the challenges that an intern will face along with their team?”

As you listen to the answer, ask yourself if these challenges excite you or if they sound dull and unappealing. The interviewer is learning if you would benefit the company, but you also see whether the company is a good fit for you.

5. What would you like to see an intern achieve in the first 60 days?

Substitute For: What are the key traits that lead to success in this internship?

What’s more exciting than a candidate who is eager to make a tangible impact at the company? Showcasing your desire to set goals and reach them is a great way to get on the interviewer’s good side.

Remember, companies take risks when they hire interns. The interns could shirk responsibilities or float through the job rather than working diligently. Setting a specific timeframe clarifies that you value the employer’s time and want them to know that you are worth the investment. So, add this to your list of questions to ask during an internship interview.

6. How does [company] equip interns to excel?

Substitute For: What can I do to excel in this internship?

The “How can I succeed here?” question is not a bad one. Simultaneously, it opens the door to a generic answer that likely references the qualities you read about in the job description. Furthermore, the interviewer may provide answers to this question throughout the interview so that the answer is already clear by the time they give you the floor.

To learn how the company treats interns, opt for the second question. You’ll be putting in hard work at the company. It’s not unreasonable to ask how the company is assisting you in your pursuits. The answer will help you form accurate expectations about the resources you’ll be receiving. On top of that, you’ll be able to learn whether the company offers the learning opportunities you’re in search of.

7. What metrics can I use to measure my performance in this role to ensure I’m positively impacting the company?

Substitute For: How will my supervisor measure my performance?

Last on our list of questions to ask in an internship interview is one that’s sure to impress. To show the interviewer that you take responsibility for your work, ask about performance metrics. This clarifies that you are willing to be accountable for your actions in the role and work hard to ensure that they are helping the department and the company.

By asking how you can measure your performance, you also show that you’re able to self evaluate. Interns are not expected to be outstanding at every task. But department heads want to know that the interns are humble enough to evaluate both successes and failures and learn from them.

Impress the Interviewer from Start to Finish

Developing fresh questions to ask during an internship interview is a worthwhile step in interview preparation. When you ask informed and distinct questions, you’ll be one step closer to sealing the deal on that dream internship.

To truly impress during an interview, commit to practicing in a way that gives you an edge. InterviewFocus is a state of the art interview preparation platform that elevates your skills in a multitude of ways.

Suppose you want a professional analysis of everything from your eye contact level to your speech rate, responses and use of fuller words. In that case, you need the state of the art technology that only InterviewFocus offers. Make InterviewFocus a part of your pre-interview strategy today!

3 Internship Interview Thank You Letter Examples | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/internship-interview-thank-you-letter/,"If you are hoping to launch your career forward, an internship is a worthwhile pursuit.

A sweeping 91 percent of employers prefer that candidates have work experience, according to a survey by The National Association of Colleges and Employers. Out of these employers, 56% prefer that the experience comes from an internship or co-op.

In addition to making you more valuable to employers, an internship offers hands-on learning and gives you a firsthand look at a specific industry.

With so much to gain, nailing your internship interview is key. An internship interview thank you letter is a great way to leave a lasting impression and encourage the interviewer to keep you in mind.

For tips on composing a professional and memorable note, read on!

Internship Interview Thank You Letter Tips

Having a shiny new internship on your resume furthers your ability to impress employers and leverage your experience into job offers down the line. To secure the role, you’ll need to be a candidate that stands out. Keep these tips in mind when composing your interview thank you letter.

First and foremost, personalize the note. The interviewer likely receives lots of generic cover letters and unoriginal notes. Your message should be a delightful break from that mold. To accomplish this, include specific references to topics that you and the interviewer discussed during your conversation. This shows that you were listening, and you care enough to remember what was discussed.

Additionally, you’ll want to emphasize your interest in the role. Ideally, you already made this point clear during the interview. Now is the time to gently bring up again why you are passionate about working for the company. You can also write a sentence or two about how your skills will translate well into the role.

Of course, the main point of this brief note is to thank the interviewer for the opportunity. Whether you think the interviewer was fair or unduly difficult, thanking them is crucial. Showcasing your gratitude for the time the interviewer allotted to you is a great way to place yourself in a positive light. Be sure to thank the interviewer and include a specific thing you are thanking them for (their time, the opportunity, getting welcomed back for another round of interviews, etc.) Companies would prefer grateful interns over entitled ones, so make sure you come across as thankful.

How to Craft the Perfect Internship Interview Thank You Letter

Now that we’ve discussed three essential components of an internship interview thank you letter, it’s time to put them into practice.

Here are three examples displaying how to end the interview process on a positive note:

Virtual Interview

An increasing number of companies are turning to virtual interviews as they search for ideal internship candidates.

What’s Inside:

A reference to a specific company value that the interviewer mentioned
A mention of past relevant experience
An ending including the day the interviewer indicated that they would reach out again

What’s Left Out:

Explanations about poor internet connection or technical difficulties
Questions about whether or not you will be selected for the internship
Any unprofessional email usernames or signatures

Virtual internship interview thank you letter example:

Hi [interviewer’s name],

Thank you for taking the time to interview me today and answering my questions about the hands-on internship program at [company name]. Speaking with you about the in-depth programs that [company name] offers made me even more excited about potentially joining the team this summer.

I am eager to put the lessons I’m learning in my journalism classes into practice during the internship. I truly believe that the writing skills I cultivated during my time working for the school newspaper will allow me to excel in this role. When you mentioned teamwork as a core value at [company name], I immediately thought about the collaborative efforts I’ve been a part of at the paper. I look forward to the opportunity to put these skills to use and learn more about the reporting and publication industry.

Thank you again for the opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you on Wednesday.

Sincerely,

[Name]

In-person interview

An in-person interview allows you to connect with the interviewer and make a more impactful impression that video calls may allow. Once you’ve answered the questions and parted ways, start drafting a thank you note like the one below.

What’s Inside:

A clear message of interest in the position
An upbeat tone and focus on the positive future
Multiple expressions of gratitude for the interviewer and the opportunity

What’s Left Out:

Questions about wages (for paid internships)
Discussion of any mishaps that happened during the interview (late arrival, misunderstanding a question, etc.)
A list of references from past bosses or colleagues (only attach this if the interviewer requests it)

In-person internship interview thank you letter example:

Dear [interviewer’s name]

What a pleasure it was to sit down with you and learn about the exciting innovations taking place in the intern program at [company name]. Thank you for allowing me to share my professional background with you and for walking me through what a day in the life of an intern looks like at [company name].

Hearing about the real-world supply chain problems that past interns have been able to solve was inspiring. The attention to detail and critical thinking skills I have developed during my time in the honors business program will come in handy during this internship. No matter what team I am assigned to, I plan to work diligently and effectively.

I appreciate the opportunity and am thankful that [company name] is considering me for this position. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to make this process run smoothly.

Best Regards,

[Name]

Multiple Rounds of Interviews

As you move deeper into the interview process, you’ll be able to get a better understanding of the company and determine if it’s a great fit for you. If so, wow them with a well-written thank you note.

What’s Inside:

A glimpse into what you have learned about the people and values of the company
The skills you bring to the table for this internship
A clear message of your enthusiasm about the internship

What’s Left Out:

Any suggestion that the company has an obligation to hire you after multiple rounds
A discussion of reimbursement for travel expenses and time
Any indication that the applicant is growing tired or impatient

Internship interview thank you letter after multiple rounds example:

Hello [interviewer’s name],

After submitting my proposals and hearing your feedback, I feel more eager than ever to join the team at [company name]. The commitment to excellence and welcoming attitude that the team displays is something that I am continually grateful for. Thank you for your time today and for inviting me back for another discussion about a role as a [company name] intern.

At each point in this process, I’ve been able to learn more about [company name], and I can picture myself more and more as a valuable member of the team.

Thank you again for the opportunity.

Respectfully,

[Name]

How to Answer Common Internship Interview Questions | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/answering-common-internship-interview-questions/,"Whether it’s your first internship or dream internship that’ll launch your career, there’s no reason to enter the room unprepared. With high-tech interview preparation platforms and information-packed resources like this article, the opportunities to strengthen your interview skills are abundant.  

In this internship interview guide, you’ll find common internship interview questions and explanations describing what the interviewer is actually asking. Plus, we’ll cover the ideal way to answer questions to dazzle on the big day. Get out a notepad, and let’s get started!

Internship Interview Questions 

Every question you’ll be asked is intentional and carefully chosen. Read the questions below and then head to the next section to develop clear and comprehensive responses.  

Getting to Know You Interview Questions

Your resume and cover letter only give a small glimpse into you and your skills. The interviewer will use questions like the ones below to get a fuller sense of who you are. 

Tell me about yourself.
How would your past coworkers/friends describe you?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
What are your future career goals?  
Past Experience Interview Questions 

To learn about your work ethic and attitude, the interviewer will ask about positions you’ve held in the past. If you don’t have much previous experience, expect questions about your academic and extracurricular activities.  

What is the biggest takeaway from your time in your last role?
How did you stay organized and meet deadlines in your last role?
What led you to choose your major?
If there’s one thing you could change about your time in your previous position, what would it be? 
Company-specific Questions 

You may be able to charm your way through certain portions of the internship interview. However, the interviewer will know whether you’re serious about the role based on your answers to company-specific questions. So be sure to research the company properly! 

Why do you want to work here?
How do you think the company/industry will change in the next five years?
What do you hope to accomplish/learn interning here? 
Do you have any questions about this company and the role? 
Behavioral Interview Questions 

An interviewer is not there to watch your daily interactions. Behavioral questions are the next best thing. Your answers give a sense of how you approach real-world situations. These questions will either ask for concrete examples from your past or be framed as hypothetical circumstances.  

Describe a time when you encountered a setback on the path to a goal. What did you do?
A team member disagrees with you about the best way to tackle an important project. How do you proceed? 
Share a time when you juggled multiple tasks. What did you do to manage the different responsibilities?
Things are fast-paced at our company. Tell me about a time when you had to think quickly on your feet in a professional setting. 
How to Answer Common Internship Interview Questions

Interviewing is about balance. To impress, you’ll need to balance being personable with being professional. These four tips will help you strike the right balance so you can perform with confidence. 

Speak with confidence, not arrogance  

The volume of your voice, the words you choose and the speed at which you speak matter. When speaking to the interviewer, make sure that you are audible and self-assured. Ending an answer with, “I guess that’s how I would explain it,” or, “So, yeah, does that make sense?” makes you appear insecure. 

Instead, share your ideas and answers with conviction. For instance, “Pursuing that job absolutely increased my interest in journalism” is much better than, “I think my time in that role kind of influenced me to look into journalism.” 

While confidence is crucial, don’t veer into arrogant territory. If an interviewer gets the sense that you believe you’re a shoo-in, they won’t be impressed. To avoid this, remain engaged, answer questions fully and discuss how you are excited to grow professionally. 

Use stories, not generic statements

Have you ever noticed that professors who tell stories in lectures are much more interesting? Take the same approach in your internship interview. Consider the fact that lots of candidates are also interested in the role. Standing out with a story is one way to remain memorable.

You can say, “I am a natural leader.” On the other hand, you can talk about a time that a team lead was unavailable, and you took the reins on a project, delegated tasks and steered the team towards a positive result. The second option is more engaging and more likely to stick in the interviewer’s mind.  

Be prepared, not robotic  

The best thing you can do before an interview is to prepare. This calms your nerves and helps you organize your thoughts. Nevertheless, there is such a thing as too much preparation. So how do you find the balance?

Your answers should be well thought out, and you should practice for the interview multiple times. However, you need to leave room for organic answers and talking points to pop up. If you memorize your answers and stick to them like a rigid script rather than a useful guide, you’ll come across as robotic. 

The interviewer wants to gauge your enthusiasm for the position. Sounding like a pre-recorded machine won’t help you display your passion. So remember that this conversation is flexible.  

Choose flattering answers, not dishonest ones

When the pressure to perform well is on, some candidates feel that embellishing past experiences will give them an edge. Don’t make this mistake. 

Lying about yourself or past experiences can come back to hurt you professionally. On top of that, it’s not ideal to start a professional relationship based on something untrue. For the company’s sake and your own, keep your answers truthful. 

You don’t have to have the best resume or the perfect answers to every question. The company is looking for interns that are willing to learn and ready to take on new challenges. A positive attitude and strong work ethic will get you much farther than a lie on your resume.   

It’s Time to Interview Like Never Before 

When it comes to interviewing, there’s always room for improvement. Fortunately, honing your interview skills has never been more convenient. With InterviewFocus, you have access to top-tier mock interview practice and real-time feedback on your performance.

How Can Students Address Academic Achievements In a Job Interview? | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/how-can-students-address-academic-achievements-in-a-job-interview/,"How Can Students Address Academic Achievements In a Job Interview?

Navigating job interviews as a college student can be daunting, especially when it comes to articulating academic achievements. We’ve gathered insights from Founders, CEOs, and other professionals to provide you with a comprehensive guide. From leveraging challenges to showcase achievements to keeping academic discussions concise and relevant, explore twelve expert strategies on how to effectively discuss your grades and coursework in a job interview.

Leverage Challenges to Showcase Achievements
Link Coursework to Job Requirements
Emphasize Value from Academic Experiences
Translate Academics into Business Achievements
Highlight Collaborative Coursework Experiences
Provide Specific Academic Project Examples
Demonstrate Skills Beyond Grades
Structure Academic Achievements Effectively
Align Academics with Job Relevance
Incorporate Academics into Your Pitch
Draw Parallels Between Coursework and Job
Keep Academic Discussions Concise and Relevant

 

Leverage Challenges to Showcase Achievements

Discussing academic achievements can dovetail seamlessly into responses to frequently asked questions such as “tell me about a challenge you have overcome”.

These kinds of questions would be a golden opportunity to discuss how students have “managed time effectively to meet a deadline” and “demonstrated excellent attention to detail and self-reflection by proofreading and refining a lackluster first draft into a first-class essay”.

Grades themselves are also excellent quantitative proof of ability, so don’t be afraid to refer to them when asked about achievements and successes. You’ve worked incredibly hard to achieve them, so show them off!

Ross Crabb, Founder, Academic Performance Coaching

 

Link Coursework to Job Requirements

College students can effectively discuss their academic achievements in job interviews by linking their coursework and grades directly to the job requirements. For instance, they might highlight maintaining a high GPA to demonstrate discipline and dedication. Discussing specific projects, like leading the development of a mobile app using JavaScript, can show practical skills relevant to the job.

It’s also beneficial to mention how such projects enhanced technical abilities and soft skills, such as leadership and project management. Expressing enthusiasm for their field and a readiness to apply and grow their skills professionally can further impress potential employers, showcasing how academic experiences have prepared them for real-world challenges.

Here’s an example of how a student might discuss their academic achievements in an interview:

“During my university years, I maintained a 3.8 GPA, which reflects my dedication and discipline in my studies. For my senior project, I led a team that developed a mobile app using JavaScript, which directly relates to the responsibilities of this position. This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also improved my leadership and project management abilities, as I coordinated between team members and managed deadlines. I’m eager to apply these skills professionally and continue to grow within this industry.”

This approach highlights the student’s achievements and demonstrates their applicability to real-world scenarios, showing the potential employer how their academic background makes them a suitable candidate for the position.

Heather O’Neill, Career Expert and Certified Professional Résumé Writer (CPRW), Resume Now

 

Emphasize Value from Academic Experiences

Don’t make it about the “grades, coursework, etc.” when you are talking about yourself during a review talk from the perspective of the value you offer. 

So, if you did a senior project or an internship where you helped a company reach a goal or improve certain stats, then talk about that. Grades by themselves will only get you so far, but everyone is looking for someone who can provide them with value.

Frankie Schell, CEO, Support You Marketing

 

Translate Academics into Business Achievements

If you want to stand out in interviewers’ minds, you have to speak their language. That means translating your academic achievements into business-relevant, project-focused accomplishments. 

Instead of sharing your GPA and some obscure elective award, provide an example of how you worked with a team to complete a complex assignment on a tight deadline. Naturally, you’ll get bonus points if the subject is relevant to your desired role, but in this instance, process trumps content. Focus your story on “the how”—the role you played and the method you used to help (or lead) the team from start to successful conclusion.

You can also take this opportunity to share an example of something that didn’t succeed. Perhaps you worked on a similar project in your freshman year, and the team tanked. In this case, your story should focus on what you learned and how you changed your approach in future endeavors. 

Tim Toterhi, CHRO, Plotline Leadership

 

Highlight Collaborative Coursework Experiences

Some students have little or no work experience to mention in a job interview. In such cases, they should highlight their coursework and academic achievements. During the interview, they should focus on courses where they worked cross-functionally, collaborating with different peers and stakeholders. 

They can also emphasize their grades and discuss how they overcame challenges in difficult classes through strategic actions. These actions demonstrate soft skills that are valuable in the workplace.

TK Morgan, Founder and Visionary, Tuesday At 1030

 

Provide Specific Academic Project Examples

One way to do this is by sharing specific examples that highlight your skills and abilities. Instead of just saying, “I got straight A’s,” you could talk about a challenging project or class where you excelled. 

Maybe mention how you tackled a tough situation or how you worked well in a group project. It’s all about showing off what you learned and how it makes you a great fit for the job. And remember, it’s not just about the grades themselves, but what you learned along the way!

Catherine Mattice, Founder and CEO, Civility Partners

 

Demonstrate Skills Beyond Grades

I wouldn’t simply list my grades and coursework in a job interview. Instead, I’d focus on how my academic achievements demonstrate skills relevant to the position. For example, if I excelled in a challenging literature course, I’d highlight the critical-thinking and analytical skills I developed rather than just mentioning the A that I received. 

Similarly, if I took the initiative in a group project, I’d emphasize my leadership and collaboration abilities, linking them back to the specific requirements of the job. By framing my academic accomplishments as transferable skills, I can show potential employers how my educational background makes me a valuable asset to their team.

Dylan Callens, Teacher and Blogger, The Teachers’ Blog

 

Structure Academic Achievements Effectively

When discussing academic achievements in a job interview, college students should focus on how their grades and coursework are relevant to the job they are applying for. Here is a structured way to present this information:

Contextualize the Achievement: Briefly mention your academic achievements, such as high grades, honors, or specific courses relevant to the job. For example, “I maintained a 3.8 GPA and excelled in courses such as Advanced Data Analysis and Machine Learning.”

Highlight Relevant Skills and Knowledge: Explain how the knowledge and skills gained from your coursework apply to the job. For instance, “Through my coursework in Advanced Data Analysis, I developed strong analytical skills and learned various statistical software programs, which I understand are crucial for this role.”

Provide Examples: Offer specific examples of projects or assignments that demonstrate your capabilities. “For example, in my Machine Learning course, I completed a project where I developed a predictive model that improved the accuracy of forecasts by 20%. This experience taught me how to handle large datasets and apply complex algorithms.”

Connect to the Job: Relate your academic achievements to the job’s requirements or the company’s needs. “I believe these skills will allow me to contribute effectively to your team, especially in developing data-driven solutions for your clients.”

By following this structure, you can effectively showcase your academic achievements and make a compelling case for how they prepare you for the job you’re seeking.

Rayn Bonus, Talent Acquisition Manager, Offshore MVP

 

Align Academics with Job Relevance

Aligning academic achievements, such as grades and coursework, with the job would be the best way for students to highlight them. Suppose the interviewer specifically doesn’t ask anything about your academics. In that case, there’s still a common question where you can throw in such information: “Tell me something about yourself.”

Don’t want to overwhelm the interviewer with academic achievements unrelated to the job position. Prioritize only the ones that have some relation to the position. If you don’t have an academic achievement related to the job, you can still mention it. For this, you have to follow up with some learning or experience that can be helpful for that job.

For example, if you majored in history and are applying for a marketing associate position, you can say something like, “My senior thesis required me to analyze vast amounts of data and draw insightful conclusions. I believe these skills would be valuable in understanding market trends and customer data.”

Kalyani Vasa, Software Engineer, ConsaInsights

 

Incorporate Academics into Your Pitch

In a job interview, I would work your relevant coursework and grades into either your elevator pitch or in the description of a project that you’ve completed. Another place it may be easy to talk about it is when discussing challenges or problems you’ve solved. 

Oftentimes, there are problems in both team and individual projects, but you could talk about how you overcame those challenges to get honors or another relevant achievement. Whatever you do, make it feel natural as part of your experience, and less like you are listing achievements.

Lela Bones, Data Engineer

 

Draw Parallels Between Coursework and Job

One effective approach for college students to discuss their academic achievements in a job interview is by highlighting how the responsibilities and outcomes of their coursework align with the requirements of the desired job. 

By drawing parallels between the skills and knowledge gained in specific courses and the competencies needed for the job, students can demonstrate their readiness and capability. For instance, discussing how successfully completing a challenging project in a relevant course reflects problem-solving skills applicable to the job role. 

Using coursework success as a surrogate measure of job success can showcase practical application and initiative. This approach not only underscores academic achievements but also illustrates the candidate’s ability to transfer theoretical knowledge into real-world scenarios, enhancing their candidacy for the position.

Keep Academic Discussions Concise and Relevant

Focus on the relevant aspects. When discussing academic achievements in a job interview, keep it concise and highlight the key points. 

Briefly mention your GPA if it’s noteworthy, but also emphasize any relevant coursework or projects that directly relate to the position you’re applying for. 

Keep it professional and to the point, showing how your academic experiences have prepared you for the role you’re pursuing.

Remain Resilient and Know Your Worth

The professional world and workforce can seem scary when you’re fresh out of college, looking for a job, or entering your first role. Two things I would tell my younger self would be to remain resilient and know your worth.

Resilience comes in handy when you’re applying for jobs and going for interviews. You’re bound to face rejections, but don’t let that discourage you. Keep at it, and don’t look back on missed opportunities. It’s what happens next that counts.

Knowing your worth is important when you’re actually in your role. This is not purely based on salaries and compensation, but rather on how you’re being treated at this company. Do you feel valued? Do you feel heard? Is your hard work recognized? Do your values align? If the answer is no to most of these questions, maybe it’s time to look for a new opportunity.

Don’t be afraid to leave jobs that don’t serve you. If you’re just entering the professional world straight out of college, don’t be afraid to jump in. The water is great. Good luck!

Shalini Ramanayake, Marketing Manager, Pulse Recruitment

 

Find an Accountability Partner

One piece of advice I’d give to transitioning students is to get an accountability partner to help keep you focused. Life outside college involves a lot of hustle—finding and applying to jobs, completing paperwork, figuring out finances. 

The problem is, when things don’t move quickly, or you get overwhelmed and confused, you lose motivation to keep going. So, you need an accountability partner who understands the goal and helps you push through the challenges until you get on your feet.

Manasvini Krishna, Founder, Boss as a Service

 

Gain Experience Through Internships

Getting vocational experience through an internship for just a few months helped me bridge the gap between education and the corporate world. It was invaluable for me in landing my first full-time job out of college. 

I undertook three months of unpaid work not long after graduating. The practical skills I learned helped improve my resume, while hands-on experience of working in a corporate environment made the transition to my full-time job a lot easier.

James Waite, Founder, Remoteopia

 

Embrace the Professional Learning Curve

Entering the professional world can be exciting, but navigating the transition can feel overwhelming. The key is to embrace the learning curve, ask questions, and showcase professionalism.

Don’t be afraid to learn from colleagues and seek guidance. Embrace the challenge. Building relationships with colleagues creates a valuable support system, all while keeping in mind that everyone starts somewhere. Focus on learning and growing, and success will follow.

Perry Zheng, Founder and CEO, Pallas

 

Initiate Conversations with Industry Pros

Moving from college to the professional world is a very difficult process, and one that can be unsuccessful for many people. Don’t be disheartened by this, though—there are many strategies and approaches that can work. 

Personally, I went for a slightly off-center approach, which worked for me. I wanted to become a graphic designer, so my initial approach was to research the best and most appealing agencies in my area. I also put together a portfolio of my work. But the usual approach would be to simply go down the ‘here’s my portfolio, do you have a job?’ route. 

I didn’t actually do that—my first port of call was to start a conversation with someone from each of the agencies and do two things: compliment a specific piece of their work and ask for some advice—ideally in person. Just five minutes of their time at their studio to get some advice opens things up in a different way. 

You get face-to-face with someone in the industry; they immediately get an idea about your personality and character—which wouldn’t come across via email. This helped me massively. I got a multitude of meetings with industry professionals who were happy to spend a few minutes with me, give some feedback, and get to know me a bit. One of the agencies clicked with me on a personal level, and I was offered a job as a junior. The rest is history. 

The lesson learned is—think about an approach from a different angle. Be bespoke—research what they do. Make it about them.

James Sanderson, Creative Director, EverydaySomething

 

Network to Ease Career Transition

In college, I made a point to network with as many people as possible. When I graduated, this gave me a large network to call upon to help me start my career, and it worked. I started as an analyst in the same company as a friend, which really eased the transition. 

And I would recommend that new graduates do the same. Try to find a career that starts alongside someone familiar. It’s much easier than joining a company that is completely unfamiliar.

Bill Mann, Privacy Expert, Cyber Insider

 

Leverage Academic Networks for Entrepreneurship

Transitioning from a grad student to an entrepreneur involved a significant mindset shift, from academic learning to real-world application and from structured guidance to self-direction. One specific strategy that helped me successfully adapt was leveraging my academic network. I actively sought advice and mentorship from professors who had industry experience or entrepreneurial backgrounds. 

Their insights into the business world were invaluable, providing practical advice that complimented my academic knowledge. Additionally, I engaged in networking events and workshops within the university and the broader entrepreneurial community, which helped me build relationships that later supported my business endeavors.

Another crucial strategy was embracing continuous learning, but in a more self-directed manner. I dedicated time to learn about areas beyond my academic expertise, such as marketing, finance, and sales, which are critical to running a successful business. Online courses, webinars, and industry literature were instrumental in this self-education process.

This combination of leveraging academic networks for mentorship and embracing a self-directed learning approach in practical business areas provided a strong foundation for my transition into entrepreneurship. It underscored the importance of community and continuous growth, key elements that have continued to play a significant role in my professional journey.

Matthew Ramirez, Founder, StudyNova

 

Be Tactful and Work Hard

I taught myself how to toe the company line. Coming out of college, I was quite idealistic and opinionated. The latter doesn’t generally bode well in the professional working world. 

So, I had to learn to keep my opinions to myself, put my head down, and work hard. Therefore, my tip is to be remarkable with your work and tactful with your words.

Marc Bromhall, Founder, StorageBuddy

 

Combine Continuous Learning with Networking

Reflecting on my transition from college to the professional world, the journey was both challenging and enriching. After completing my studies in digital communication and media/multimedia at the University of Rochester, I knew that to make a mark in the competitive fields of design and branding, I would need to differentiate myself.

A key strategy that helped me adapt successfully was the integration of continuous learning with real-world application. Throughout my college years and beyond, I was not just focused on acquiring knowledge but also on applying this knowledge in practical settings. This approach allowed me to build a robust portfolio early on.

Networking was another critical component of my transition. I made it a point to connect with professionals across various industries, which opened up opportunities that were crucial for my growth. This proactive approach in building relationships and staying engaged with industry trends helped me navigate through the initial uncertainties of the professional world.

Moreover, my move from Estonia to New York was driven by a desire to be at the center of innovation and creativity. The city’s dynamic environment provided the perfect backdrop for my professional growth, challenging me to continuously improve and adapt.

In sum, my transition was marked by a combination of continuous learning, strategic networking, and a proactive approach to seizing opportunities, all of which were integral in shaping my career path from a fresh graduate to a recognized professional in my field.

Valev Laube, Branding Expert, Designer and Marketing Director, Valev Laube

 

Expand Connections via Professional Circles

My work as a college student was assisted by networking, which made my transition to the workplace more challenging. Socializing with other students and learning from their experiences through industry events and conferences was another strategy I adopted to cope during the pandemic. Through participation in professional circles within my niche, I have expanded my connections and acquired invaluable trade secrets.

Similarly, we did the same for a technology client of ours by arranging and sponsoring industry events for which they provide solutions. We carried out a six-month sales strategy, with the main focus on nurturing professional relationships, which resulted in a 30% increase in new business opportunities and a 20% rise in customer retention rates.

Besides connecting with personnel to grow my business network, networking has provided me with a valuable way to sharpen my skills and gain knowledge in my career.

Synchronize Schoolwork with Startup Goals

Transitioning from one chapter to the next in any circumstance can be difficult. With my startup, I found myself in a constant struggle to balance my schoolwork and professional life. For me, the best strategy was to synchronize the two. Because I was so passionate about my mission for Natics, a lot of this naturally reflected in my schoolwork. It was also a great opportunity to network and gain some interest and credibility in the field I was trying to get into from my classmates and professors. As I phased out of classes to focus on Natics full-time, I learned the confidence in networking and putting your ideas out there. Age is your asset, not your weakness.

Zavier Hasnani, Co-Founder and President, Natics Skincare

 

Network Beyond College for Success

Making the shift from college to the working world can be exciting and intimidating at the same time. I found that adopting an attitude of constant learning and flexible agility was essential to effective adaptation. This response is by Erica Tan, the CEO and Co-founder of Best in Singapore. The website’s goal is to produce the most dependable consumer-focused reviews in Singapore.

It can be a daunting experience to graduate from college and enter the profession. Many students are worried about how they will handle the change and feel unprepared. Thankfully, the transition from being a college student to a young professional can be made easier by a few factors.

Continue to network

Your network might be limited as a college student. Nonetheless, since most academics have ties within the fields they teach, you can take advantage of their networks to begin forming professional partnerships. You can network with people at different stages of their careers through the alumni programs offered by many colleges. Never be afraid to proactively build a relationship with them by contacting them on LinkedIn. Lastly, professional associations or clubs in your industry could provide beneficial networking opportunities. Having a network is essential for a successful transition from college to the workplace; don’t be scared to network.

Erica Tan, CEO, Best in Singapore

 

Share Feelings to Transition Smoothly

Every closing chapter of our lives deserves a proper farewell; otherwise, it would be quite difficult for us to move on from that phase and completely adapt to a new chapter. The truth is, I was quite overwhelmed during my transition from college to the professional world, not just because I had a new schedule, but also because I was confronted with newer expectations and responsibilities that honestly felt too far outside of my comfort zone.

I realized that sharing my feelings of fear and anxiety with others was one of the ways I could safely maintain a healthy and positive mindset as I approached the professional world. And by talking to others about my fears and anxiety, I was able to learn that I was not alone in my worries. I also learned that this was only a passing phase.

Letting myself grieve the closing phase of one stage of my life—college—was one strategy that helped me smoothly transition and successfully adapt to my new reality as an employee and a member of a work team. Allowing myself to go through the stages of grief of losing my friends, and losing the freedom that, up until that moment, I never realized was associated with being financially dependent on others and not having to go out and earn a living for myself, helped me properly reorder my priorities and to prepare mentally for the changes I would have to adapt to.

Andrew Johnson, General Manager, Drughelpline

 

Adopt a Consistent Professional Schedule

I tell people to begin operating on a professional schedule as soon as possible after graduation. College can be a bit of a free-for-all when it comes to schedules. Some days you might have an 8 a.m. class, and other days you won’t have one until noon, which means your wake-up times might be different every day.

I suggest getting into a rhythm of going to bed at roughly the same time and getting up at the same time for a few weeks before you start a job. It’ll be less of a shock to your system when your alarm goes off on the first Monday morning of your new job.

Heather O’Neill, Career Expert and Certified Professional Résumé Writer (CPRW), Resume Now

 

Apply College Learning to Diverse Fields

I am one of those people who took their college degree, hung it on the wall, and went to do something completely different. But my tip won’t be to just go and forget everything they’ve taught you in college. On the contrary: Take it all and implement it! This is what I’ve done. With an MA in literature and language, I now work as a content editor and edit mostly HVAC-related content. So, how does Shakespeare help you write or edit HVAC? 

If studied thoroughly, in all the breadth and depth of his thought and language, Shakespeare can help you do just about anything. In other words, a college education isn’t there to teach you any single subject matter (even though it will do that, too). It’s there to teach you how to learn, understand, take any topic, and look at it from different, rich, and unique viewpoints.

Jelena Ciric, Content Editor, BG Electrical & Air Con

 

Build Relationships with Experienced Mentors

Actively seek out mentors or professionals in your desired field. Networking and building relationships with individuals who have experience can provide valuable insights, guidance, and opportunities. Don’t hesitate to ask for advice or feedback from your mentors as you navigate your career path.

You should focus on continuous learning and skill development because it’s crucial.

The professional world is constantly evolving, and staying up-to-date with industry trends, technologies, and best practices can help you remain competitive and adaptable.

Highlighting Internships & Projects: 15 Tips for Students with Limited Experience | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/highlighting-internships-projects-tips-for-students-with-limited-experience/,"Highlighting Internships & Projects: 15 Tips for Students with Limited Experience

Navigating the job market with limited work experience can be daunting for college students, but with insights from seasoned professionals like a VP of Strategy and Growth and an HR director, it becomes manageable. From quantifying internship achievements to creating a project portfolio section, we’ve compiled fifteen invaluable strategies. Discover how to effectively showcase your internships and relevant projects, as advised by top industry leaders.

Include Strong References for Backup

Quantify Internship Achievements

When you’re short on work experience, the key to making your internships and projects shine is to focus on the results you achieved. Instead of just listing your responsibilities, explain what you accomplished and the skills you used to get there. 

Did you increase website traffic by 10% through your marketing project? Did you manage a team project that came in under budget? Mention that! Quantify your achievements whenever possible, and show how your work made a real impact. This will grab the employer’s attention and show them you’re a go-getter, even with limited experience.

Kimberley Tyler-Smith, VP of Strategy and Growth, Resume Worded

 

Showcase Results and Transferable Skills

Showing off accurate results is essential for college students who want to showcase their internships and projects, despite having little work experience. 

Even a small project can make a significant impact. 

For example, if you increased network efficiency during your internship, show how much faster it became or how much less time you spent on the network.

Don’t forget to tell stories. Create a resume or portfolio that tells the story of your experiences. 

Tell stories about the obstacles you faced and how you overcame them creatively. Problem-solving and adaptability are two skills employers love to see in you.

And don’t forget to take advantage of any transferable skills you acquired while interning. 

Did you learn how to communicate better with your team? Or perhaps you learned how to manage your time more effectively under tight deadlines. Both of these skills are valuable in any work environment.

Lastly, make sure you’re networking like it’s the 21st century. Attend industry gatherings, network with experts on LinkedIn, and seek out in-depth interviews. There’s never a dull moment when a connection is made.

Don’t forget that experience isn’t about quantity; it’s about quality and relevance.

Laviet Joaquin, Marketing Head, TP-Link

 

Dedicate a Resume Section for Projects

To effectively showcase internships or projects with limited work experience, college students should create a dedicated resume section. Describe projects with quantifiable achievements, use action verbs, and include relevant technical skills to impress potential employers.

Kristina Ramos, Reverse Recruiter, Find My Profession

 

Match Skills to Job Requirements

As a recruiter, fresh graduates who mention job-relevant skills they developed or polished while working on a project or as an intern stand out to me. Therefore, I recommend carefully reviewing the job description and making note of the specific skills, experiences, and qualifications required for the position. You can then reflect on your past internships or projects and identify instances where you have gained relevant skills and experiences that match the job requirements.

On your resume, it’s best to provide concrete examples and details of your accomplishments during your internships/projects, including any relevant metrics or results achieved. For instance, if the job requires experience using certain software that you actually used at your internship, make sure to mention that in bold text under your internship details in the Work Experience section of your resume. Tying your experiences back to the job requirements and demonstrating how they have prepared you for success in the position is key to getting hired when you have no actual employment history.

Joe Coletta, Founder & CEO, 180 Engineering

 

Align Work with Job Description Keywords

The best way to highlight your internship and project experience is by aligning the work you’ve done to the job description, using keywords and mirroring phrases. Emphasize whatever component of your internship or project that matches the job you are applying to, instead of listing out everything you did. 

Also, be sure to focus on the actual work you did, the steps you implemented, and any initiative you took; do not spend precious space describing the project or the internship program.

Mofei Xu, Career Coach, Mofei Xu Career Coaching

 

Develop a Case Study or Portfolio

Create a case study or portfolio feature for the work that was completed during your internship or project. Showing that you are going above and beyond to highlight the relevant experience in a way that can be easily connected to professional duties will help connect the dots for hiring managers.

Jason Miller, Digital Marketing Manager, York University

 

Highlight Applied Skills and Results

Noting internships and fellowships on a resume is a wonderful way to build work experience. Some of these experiences may be rewarded through academic course credit, monetary pay, and/or custom recognition channels. Even unpaid opportunities, aside from volunteer work, contribute as a valuable source when building a professional portfolio of work. Hosting skill sets is fine, but it holds no merit until individuals can prove they’re applying these skill sets in real-life settings. 

When theory translates to application, then there’s a reason for employers to take interest in exploring how these potential candidates can optimally contribute to their organizations. The resume can exhibit different genres of projects that you’ve worked on by stating the objective of the internship/fellowship, sharing the tasks that were assigned during the duration of the commitment, and disclosing lessons learned from the project. Make sure to quantify certain aspects of your work experience so employers can automatically learn the duration of your commitment and understand the measurable metrics that were used to track performance. 

For example, if a student had to produce X reports within a week at their internship, they need to frame the context of their contribution without appearing too nebulous. They were chosen to honor such roles for a reason; therefore, highlight the strengths through skills that were applied and new skills that were acquired. Ambitious employers are seeking candidates who are willing to showcase their ongoing professional development while paying attention to the results of their work.

Sasha Laghonh, Founder, Sasha Talks

 

Treat Internships as Professional Experience

Experience is experience. College students should create a resume highlighting internships and projects in the same way they would a paid position and speak to them in interviews. 

Be mindful of the keywords called out in the job(s) they are applying for and interviewing for when describing responsibilities and skills acquired. The key is to clearly outline what they’ve learned and the successes they’ve accomplished.

Mandy Schaniel, Founder & CEO, Schaniel Consulting Inc.

 

Include Strong References for Backup

Sometimes all you need is a little backup when it comes to quantifying your achievements that were garnered outside of the workplace. This is where references come in handy. Be sure to include references from supervisors, professors, or mentors who can speak to your skills, work ethic, and performance during your internships or projects. A positive reference can strengthen your application and validate your qualifications, making it more likely for you to stand out against others who might be in the same position.

Make sure to mention these references in the interview process and provide them without needing to be asked. This makes it more of a seamless process and creates less work for recruiters.

Michael Banis, Chief Development Officer, Virtue Recovery Centers

 

Emphasize the Value Added to Organizations

As an organizational perspective, we are keen to know more about the internship in terms of how it has been beneficial or added value to the organization. Students often make the usual mistake of explaining the project’s WHAT & HOW, but I would suggest more representation on WHY is required, and it should touch the prospective organization.

Vipul Annadate, Manager HR, K D Aher Building Systems Pvt. Ltd.

 

Craft Targeted Resumes and Cover Letters

College students with limited work experience can effectively highlight their internships or relevant projects by crafting targeted resumes and cover letters. Focus on showcasing specific achievements, skills, and experiences gained during internships or projects, emphasizing relevant tasks and accomplishments. 

Additionally, leverage online platforms such as LinkedIn to create a professional profile highlighting these experiences, engaging in networking opportunities, and joining relevant groups or communities to connect with professionals in the field. 

Finally, during interviews, confidently articulate the value and skills acquired through internships or projects, demonstrating enthusiasm and a proactive attitude toward learning and professional development.

Steven Mostyn, Chief Human Resources Officer, Management.org

 

Collect and Display Social Proof

Use social proof to highlight your projects. Make sure to release the projects and keep them live on a website. 

Additionally, you can launch them on platforms like GitHub/Product Hunt. When you list your project in the resume, highlight social metrics like GitHub stars, Product Hunt rank, or even website visitors, and include a link to your website. This is a good way to stand out from the crowd.

Deepti Chopra, Co-founder, Adaface

 

Build a Strong Personal Brand

I emphasize the significance of harnessing the power of personal branding for college students aiming to stand out with their internships or relevant projects. Crafting a personal brand that resonates with their career aspirations and professional ethos can serve as a beacon for potential employers.

This can be achieved by consistently sharing insights, learnings, and achievements related to their field of interest across social media and professional networking platforms. Curating content that reflects their professional identity and expertise not only showcases their dedication and passion but also positions them as thought leaders among their peers.

By authentically communicating their unique values and visions, students can effectively highlight their potential and readiness for the professional world, even with limited work experience. Thus, personal branding emerges as a strategic tool in bridging the gap between their current academic pursuits and future career goals.

Amit Doshi, Founder & CEO, MyTurn

 

Be Honest About Your Experience

Be honest about your level of experience and don’t try to pad out your past roles if it’s not necessary. Be open about the experience you do have, and be willing to communicate that experience (do not lie or worry about a seemingly lesser amount of experience in your roles).

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Create a Project Portfolio Section

I recommend that college students create a Project Portfolio segment in their resumes or LinkedIn profiles to highlight their internships or relevant projects. This goes beyond merely listing the internships or projects; it’s about storytelling and showcasing the impact of their work through a curated collection of tangible outcomes, learnings, and visual aids.

We often look for candidates who can demonstrate their contributions and learning experiences visually and contextually. For a college student, this could include links to digital portfolios, project websites, or even brief video presentations summarizing key projects undertaken during their internships.

Each project in the portfolio should highlight specific skills used, challenges overcome, and the value added to the project or internship role. For example, if a student worked on a marketing campaign for a new product, they could include campaign visuals, any data on increased engagement or sales, and a brief analysis of what strategies worked and what they learned.

When stepping into an interview, aligning your career aspirations with the company’s vision can be a game-changer. We’ve gathered insights from CEOs and senior consultants, among others, to bring you fourteen strategic tips. From showcasing your strengths and proposing initiatives to asking strategic questions, discover how to resonate with your future employer’s vision.

Showcase Strengths and Propose Initiatives

When aligning your career goals with the vision of a company you are interviewing with, it’s essential to demonstrate how your strengths can contribute to the company’s success while addressing any potential gaps. 

During the interview, emphasize your existing strengths that directly align with the company’s vision and goals. Highlight specific skills, experiences, and achievements that demonstrate your ability to contribute to the company’s success. For example, if the company is focused on innovation and you have a track record of implementing creative solutions in your previous roles, emphasize this as a strength that you can bring to the new company. 

By showcasing your existing strengths, you can illustrate how you are well-positioned to support the company’s vision from day one. Consider the potential gaps or areas where the company may benefit from your expertise. During the interview, propose specific action items that you can focus on to enhance the company’s business value and profitability. This could involve outlining potential projects, initiatives, or strategies that align with the company’s vision and can contribute to its growth. 

By presenting concrete action items, you demonstrate your proactive approach and commitment to driving the company toward its strategic goals. The key is to showcase not only your qualifications and experience but also your strategic thinking and proactive mindset.

Yemisi Iyilade, Senior Consultant, YEMISIIYILADE.COM

 

Analyze LinkedIn Profiles and Company Culture

Your best insight into the company’s culture and beliefs is not coming from their website; that’s an advertisement. The most honest places where they portray themselves are on the LinkedIn personal profiles of the principals and officers and on the company’s profile page. Read what they are saying there about themselves and their adherence to the company’s mission, both on the surface and deeper between the lines. Notice how they post news about the company and other material to share with their industry. Determine if they lead the industry with original thought or follow along with little value added. 

You want to be part of a mover-and-shaker company, not a laggard. Before your interview, get the names of everyone you will meet in HR and in management, and review their personal profiles to beef up the questions you can ask them about themselves, their history there, and promotions within the company, their perspective on why you may want to work there that is not obvious from their LinkedIn presence. Make this interview a dual conversation, with foreknowledge and prior research, not one where they ask you all the questions.

Marc W. Halpert, LinkedIn coach, trainer, marketing consultant, connect2collaborate.com

 

Inquire About Promotion Tracks

I recommend that candidates should always ask what the promotion track looks like for the job they are applying for. If the role they would have one to two promotions down the line aligns with their career goals, then they will be even more excited to join the company and motivated by their work. On the flip side, if it isn’t of interest to them, then they might have issues staying motivated and finding their work rewarding.

Corey Schwitz, CEO & Founder, Skydog Ops

 

Become an Aspirational Archaeologist

Beyond superficial sound bites, genuine alignment springs from marrying your unique growth trajectory to an organization’s transformative path forward. Early on, I coached candidates to parrot mission statements verbatim. Quickly, I realized leaders crave contributors who deeply internalize values as personal guideposts for impact. Now, I advise job seekers to become archaeologists of aspiration—excavate beneath polished positioning to unearth the raw human hopes propelling a company’s existence. 

Scour interviews, press releases, and even Glassdoor reviews to decode their distinct dialect of purpose. Then, trace how your specific skills and experiences can accelerate their evolution. Perhaps you’re a data scientist passionate about ethical AI, pursuing roles with healthcare startups pioneering equitable diagnosis algorithms. Articulate how your blend of technical chops and social consciousness uniquely equips you to responsibly scale their products while safeguarding patient trust. 

The key is positioning yourself as a co-creator, not just an employee. Ignite imagination around how you’ll materially advance their mission through the vehicle of your own career vision. Alignment shines when individual and institutional ambitions share a horizon.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-founder and CEO, EchoGlobal Tech

 

Match Career Goals with Corporate Values

Start by searching the “About Us” section of the company’s website and looking for their Corporate Values. This list of values will let you know what the company thinks is most important in a prospective candidate for hire. (They are actually telling you what to focus on during the interview.) The list will also closely align with the company’s corporate vision.

Look for ways that you can match up your career goals with these values and the corporate vision.

For example, if the number one value is “Quality,” ask yourself, “If the company hires me for this position, in what ways would I be able to improve quality for them?” Think about ways that you have accomplished that in prior work that you have done. Have those examples ready when you walk in for the interview!

Doug Staneart, CEO, Fearless Presentations

 

Be Honest About Personal and Professional Seasons

Consider your life situation and the season of your life, both professionally and personally. Be honest if you are re-entering a career after taking care of your kids for the past five years, if you are a caregiver for an aging parent, if you are in a transition in your life such as a divorce, a state move, or any other situation you are currently in. The employer will appreciate your openness and honesty upfront, as well as how they can work with you to align the workload and your schedule. 

There will always be changes in the seasons of life, so make sure that your employer knows you are committed to bringing your best and contributing to the growth and development of the company. Whether you are just starting in your career or advancing in it, don’t be afraid to tell the company what you hope to accomplish in your career. Make sure you ask questions during the interview that will help you maintain a healthy work-life balance and allow you to advance within the organization.

Olga Kovtun, Marketing Coordinator, HRPro

 

Validate Company Vision with Employee Insights

I think the better challenge is to first look at the vision of a company and learn everything you can about that company—you can start with the basics like a website or LinkedIn Company Page. But the more important exercise is to talk to a few people who actually work there via networking; ask them their thoughts about the company’s vision. See how their answers compare to the company’s marketing of it. 

Once you have validated what they say and what others confirm it’s really like, if that opportunity is of interest to you, now it’s important to see how it stacks up to your career goals. Is it a fit? Let’s assume it is for the sake of an upcoming job interview.

When you go through your STAR or PAR examples, what ways can you use examples that align with the company’s vision from what you have done in the past? When you prep for questions about yourself and what you want, how can you craft authentic answers that relate to your goals and their vision? Interviews are about selling yourself, so by doing the research to know what your audience is looking for, it next becomes your job to focus on selling yourself into that equation.

Working with a coach to hone in on this strategy can be really beneficial because most candidates are too surface-level with their approach; one needs to go deeper and more technical in their answers while being true to themselves to stand out.

Nikki Ryberg, MHRLR, CPRW, GCDF, Career Coach, Ryberg Group, LLC

 

Engage in Early Skills Alignment Conversations

Candidates can align their career goals with the vision of the company they are interviewing with by engaging in early conversations that uncover skills or competencies needed to assist in carrying out the vision of the company at the level of the employee. 

For example, if interviewing for Amazon for a customer service position and knowing their vision is, “Our vision is to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online,” the employee may pursue podcasts such as “Creating Disney Magic: Lessons in Leadership, Management, and Customer Service” or similar podcasts to help develop skills that are synergistic with the vision and pertinent to the customer service role.

Celeste Davis, CPO

 

Create a Vision Integration Map

My best tip is to create a Vision Integration Map.

First, thoroughly research the company’s vision, mission, and recent initiatives. Then, draw up a map that visually connects your past experiences, skills, and aspirations with various aspects of the company’s vision. This could be a mind map or a simple chart. The idea is to create a visual representation that clearly shows how your career trajectory and achievements align with and can also contribute to advancing the company’s strategic goals.

For example, if the company is committed to sustainability and you’ve worked on projects that reduced waste or improved energy efficiency, highlight these experiences in your map. If innovation is a core part of the company’s mission, detail how your innovative thinking or past projects have led to successful outcomes. This method allows you to enter the interview with a straightforward, compelling narrative demonstrating alignment and actively contributing to the company’s future.

Presenting this Vision Integration Map during your interview can set you apart as a candidate who has not only done their homework but also creatively thought about how they can be an asset to the team. It showcases your analytical skills, ability to synthesize information meaningfully, and genuine interest in contributing to the company’s success.

This helps candidates demonstrate a deep alignment with a company’s vision, making it clear they’re not just looking for any job, but a role in which they can actively participate in the company’s journey and contribute to its long-term success.

Laurie Hyllberg, Vice President, Kinsa Group

 

Research and Share Passionate Examples

Research. Check out the hiring company’s mission statement, About page, their work, social posts, etc., and try to find common ground with your own career goals and interests. You can even go one step further and share a direct example with some specificity to impress further while trying to bring aspects you’re passionate about into the mix. The more passionate and committed you come across, the higher your chances of landing the job become.

Christopher Thoma, Head of Media, CareerAddict

 

Highlight Skills that Complement Company Values

During the interview, be prepared to discuss how your career goals align with the vision and values of the company. Highlight specific areas where your skills, experiences, and values complement those of the company. 

For example, if the company values innovation and you have a track record of introducing new ideas or processes, emphasize how you can contribute to the company’s culture of innovation.

Terry Jackson, COO

 

Sell What the Buyer Is Buying

Candidates can align their career goals with the vision of the company they are interviewing with by asking questions during the interview. In other words, you want to sell what the buyer is buying. However, you can only do that by asking follow-up questions during the interview to ensure that you have all the information. 

For example, when an interviewer asks why you’re interested in the role, ask them to share more. This will allow you to align your responses further within the process, including your career goals.

Valerie Martinelli, MPA, CEO , Valerie Martinelli Consulting, LLC 

 

Weave Career Story with Company’s Vision

And then, it is the golden tip for the candidate: how to align career goals with the vision of the company with which the interview is taking place. The candidate should see the strategic opportunity during the course of the interview so as to show how they can be aligned with the company’s mission and goals.

This should come through by immersing oneself deeply in understanding the mission statement, the values, and the larger objectives that the company has previously set. By understanding these key facts, a candidate will be in a better position to explain in a manner that shows how their career aspirations aren’t just in cooperation but in collaboration with the company’s vision.

Then the candidates cleverly weave their career story into the fabric of the company’s vision during the interview itself, not to state future goals as classic teacher questions suppose, but to show how the few goals they do have are in favor of the path the firm could be on. This perhaps means linking certain skills or experiences to an individual that could directly correlate with the goals of the company.

This will further be achieved when candidates ask questions that bring to the forefront how the vision is achievable with their involvement. Actually, this not only points out the zeal and interest in seeking to understand the vision of the company but also underscores the eagerness to have a significant contribution in achieving that vision.

Viktoriia Prydatko, HR and Tech Recruiter, HireDevelopersBiz

 

Research Company and Ask Strategic Questions

Before the interview, thoroughly research the company’s mission statement, values, and long-term goals. Understand what they stand for, what they aim to achieve, and how they differentiate themselves from competitors. This will provide you with insight into their overall vision. 

Then, throughout the interview, take the opportunity to ask questions that further demonstrate your alignment with the company’s vision. Inquire about upcoming initiatives, challenges, or opportunities that relate to your career goals. This shows your genuine interest in contributing to the company’s success in areas that matter to both you and the company you are interviewing with.

Showcase Real Weaknesses with Improvement Strategies

Years back, the practiced answer was usually something along the lines of “I work too hard” or “I’m a perfectionist.” We tended to look for answers that would make the companies like us. Now, too many people have adopted that approach, and companies are turned off by the lack of vulnerability these answers offer. This puts candidates in a tricky spot because being too honest could backfire.

I think answers that involve specific examples of a few areas where things come harder but also offer ways they’ve improved (systems, processes, courses, etc.) are great. I also think using real weaknesses but then selling why they are actually a strength can be good, too. 

For instance, I’m too impatient at times, which can lead to impulsive decisions, but it also means I never miss a deadline and am always early to meetings. I have learned this about myself and now put parameters in place, such as strategies X and Y, to ensure I do the due diligence I need to before making a critical decision.

An answer like this is real; it can show the positive aspect of the trait and the real-life workaround one implements because of it.

Nikki Ryberg, MHRLR, CPRW, GCDF, Career Coach, Ryberg Group, LLC

 

Lead with Authenticity and Highlight Improvement Steps

Honesty is a powerful tool when answering difficult interview questions, including those about your “weaknesses” or areas of opportunity. Although you want to be careful not to mention being bad at something that is listed in the basic job requirements, you don’t have to try to turn your weakness into a strength either. Instead, lead with authenticity and highlight the steps you’re taking to improve.

If you’re struggling to come up with weaknesses, turn to your performance evaluations to see what feedback you’ve received in the past. You can also look to those around you for feedback. This can be as simple as asking, “I’m preparing for an upcoming job interview. Can you please share a few of my greatest strengths as well as my biggest weakness?”

Dr. Kyle Elliott, Founder & Tech Career Coach, CaffeinatedKyle.com

 

Combine Humor with Active Solutions

When you’re hit with the “weaknesses” question in an interview, it’s a golden opportunity. Start with a little humor, maybe confessing your love for puns or your knack for turning any situation into a sitcom-worthy joke. Then, get down to the nitty-gritty by admitting something genuine, such as overcommitting due to enthusiasm or being too critical of your own work. 

Wrap it up by highlighting how you’re actively working on these areas, whether it’s through time-management techniques, seeking feedback, or honing your skills. It’s about being authentic, a little funny, and demonstrating your dedication to self-improvement.

Crystal Clark, Communications Manager, City of Tampa

 

Frame Weakness in Context of Proactive Improvement

When faced with the “weakness” question, the best approach is to be candid while framing it in the context of proactive improvement. Start by choosing a genuine area where you’ve faced challenges, but make sure it’s not a critical skill for the role you’re applying for. Then discuss specific steps you’ve taken to address this weakness. 

For example, if you struggle with public speaking, you might want to say: “I’ve always found public speaking to be stressful, which I know is important for teamwork and leadership. To improve, I’ve joined a local Toastmasters club to communicate my ideas clearly and with confidence.” This approach will show honesty, your willingness to keep working on yourself, and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities for growth.

Bayu Prihandito, Founder, Psychology Consultant, Life Coach for Men, Life Architekture

 

Focus on Learning and Growth Over Cliché Answers

Flip the answer to what you hope to learn or improve. Instead of the cliché answer “I’m a perfectionist,” try: “I’m learning that progress matters more than perfection.” Instead of “I work too hard,” try: “I had to recognize that what I thought was working too hard was actually me being inefficient, so I worked on my time management and organizational skills.” What you are doing here is showing self-awareness and growth versus saying what you think they want to hear.

Mathew Fox, Founder, Embedded Talent

 

Demonstrate Commitment to Enhancing Weaknesses

Candidates can approach the “weaknesses” question in a way that doesn’t truly admit a weakness. Demonstrate that you are trying to enhance your “weakness” through your commitment to self-improvement with a plan to turn it into a strength and how it could benefit others. Be candid in your responses because it demonstrates humility and the fact that you’re not perfect, but that you are learning and willing to take action to improve yourself when needed.

Valerie Martinelli, MPA, CEO, Valerie Martinelli Consulting, LLC 

 

Use Feedback to Show Growth and Continuous Improvement

I believe what employers are really trying to get at when they ask the ‘tell me your greatest weakness’ question (which could really be worded in a much better, more behaviorally based way) is to determine where a candidate needs to grow or what areas they will need support in, and also to see how a candidate has acted on those areas. 

A great way to answer this is to give an example of previous feedback you’ve received from a leader, manager, or supervisor on an opportunity to improve, and then showcase what steps you have taken to act on that feedback. 

For example, you could say, “In my previous performance reviews, an area of growth for me has been time management. I’ve made strides to improve in that area by leveraging my electronic calendar better, using an app to manage my to-do list, and taking a virtual course on prioritization.” This gives the employer real-life, behaviorally based answers and an example of an area you need to work on, as well as demonstrates your ability to accept negative feedback and act on it to ensure you are meeting expectations. 

Overall, I believe it is key for a candidate to approach this question in a way that demonstrates that “weaknesses” are really just opportunities for continuous improvement, and that you are always striving to be a better version of yourself. Everyone has areas to work on, so don’t be ashamed or try to guess what the employer wants to hear. Give an honest, real-life example and demonstrate how you have worked on that opportunity, and you will have nothing to fear!

Heather Kerr, Human Resources Manager

 

Share a Journey from Recognizing to Overcoming Weakness

A good friend of mine, when asked in interviews to identify his biggest weakness, would answer, “chocolate.” Typically, the interviewer and my friend would share a laugh and move on. Sometimes, they’d share a laugh, and then the interviewer would ask him to answer seriously, which he did.

Whether you want to recycle the chocolate joke or not, it is a good idea to be prepared for all questions likely to be asked in an interview, including identifying your biggest weaknesses. When you’re discussing weaknesses, choose ones that are real, explain how you came to understand that you needed to get better, what you did to get better, and how that paid off. 

You want the interviewer to understand that you used to have that weakness but no longer do, but you can’t just say that as it is too conclusory. You want to convince them, and to do that, you need to take them on that little journey about how you came to realize you had a problem, how you fixed it, and how that’s been beneficial to your employers.

Steven Rothberg, Founder and Chief Visionary Officer, College Recruiter

 

Present Weaknesses with Actions Taken and Results

This is a question where some humility is expected, but it’s also a chance to showcase resilience. You don’t want to highlight a weakness that is essential to the job in question, so be mindful and cautious with what weakness you select and present to hiring managers.

Use this as an opportunity to share an actual instance of this weakness, with actions taken, and the results to demonstrate how you overcame that scenario. In doing so, you’ll demonstrate your commitment to self-improvement and to tackling tough situations.

Christopher Thoma, Head of Media, CareerAddict

 

Emphasize Team Role Awareness and Strengths Commitment

There is an argument that you’re never really going to become great at the things you’re not good at. And that, therefore, you should focus on becoming the best you can be at the things that come naturally to you and that you enjoy, or don’t mind doing. 

For example, if your brain wants to explode whenever you look at a spreadsheet, or you want to fall asleep whenever anyone starts talking conceptually, then there’s not much point in trying to mold or force yourself to be someone who works with numbers all day or has to work on conceptualizing as a primary function of their role. The best teams are the ones where each person knows what their strengths are and is okay with other people taking control of their gaps. 

A team will not work if everyone is trying to do everything. So, sharing this honesty with a potential employer shows that you have awareness of what strengths you can bring to the company, shows awareness and willingness that you are able to communicate and ask for help from other team members, and shows that you understand what you can commit to improving so that you can be the best at what you’re best at.

Hannah Ray, Life, Career + Business Coach, TAKE Coaching Amsterdam

 

Detail Specific Strategies for Addressing Growth Areas

To help your interviewer understand how you’re approaching a perceived weakness (or a growth area in general), share specific examples of strategies you’ve tried.

If time management is a challenge, you could list a few ways you’ve tried to restructure your schedule, build consistent habits, prioritize effectively, or project-manage your work. Explain what did and didn’t work for you (and if you have time, explain why).

In the end, try to tie it back to the job you’re interviewing for. Talk about how your new skills and insights will help your performance. Your interviewer isn’t expecting perfection—they want to know how you’re investing in yourself to be better at what you do.

Alex Lahmeyer, Founder, DEI Consultant, and Career Advisor, Boundless Arc

 

Embrace Vulnerability and Plans for Strength Conversion

Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable.

The truth is that candidates must first be aware of the fact that they have weaknesses to be able to give an honest answer to this question, much less one that showcases their commitment to self-improvement. Therefore, candidates just have to understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong with letting their vulnerability show at this point, because weaknesses are naturally part of our essence as human beings, so there is really no point in answering the weakness question with an intention to cloud your true weakness.

By far, one of the most effective ways that candidates can approach the weakness question and showcase honesty and commitment to self-improvement is to take a confessional mode and not be afraid to show their vulnerability. This is, however, not to say that they should sulk and dwell so much on the negatives of their weaknesses and fail to make mention of the plans they have for becoming better, but that they should not be afraid to share how their weaknesses have affected them in the past because this way, they demonstrate self-awareness that is committed to self-improvement.

Also, by embracing their weakness and having enough courage to be vulnerable during the job interview, they communicate their willingness to learn, grow, and convert this weakness into major strengths.

Tim Hastings, General manager, Top Rated Law

 

Provide Context to “Bad” Weaknesses with Solutions

It’s all about context. As an employer, I’d much rather hear a “really bad” weakness that has context rather than an artificial response. If someone lists “lazy” as their weakness, it sounds really bad, but if the context is, “After a long day of programming, I often feel too lazy to cook a full meal from scratch,” it’s definitely relatable. If “that’s why I like to do ingredient prepping on the weekend” is added, suddenly this makes the statement both relatable, honest, and solution-oriented.

Thomas Strobl, Founder, Fugoya

 

Utilize STAR Method to Outline Weakness and Improvement

The truth is that demonstrating competence and willingness to make improvements, even in the areas of their most profound weakness, will always work in the best interest of job candidates. 

One way that candidates can approach the weakness question in a way that showcases honesty and commitment to self-improvement is to approach the question using the STAR method. Because this method takes a four-part approach to questions, it affords candidates the opportunity to present a particular situation when their weakness threatened their efficiency in a workplace setting, the task that needed to be completed, the action that they took, and the result that was achieved.

What makes this an effective way to approach the weakness question is the fact that it allows candidates the opportunity to paint a vivid picture of the steps that they have taken to eliminate the limiting and self-stagnating effects of their weakness. 

By selecting a particular instance when their weakness challenged their ability to achieve a desired result, and strongly emphasizing the actions that were taken to mitigate this weakness, and then going on to highlight the results of these mitigative actions, candidates would be successful at marketing themselves as competent, while also showcasing honesty and commitment to self-improvement.

Andrew Johnson, General Manager, National Drug Helpline

 

Combine Candid Feedback and Self-Awareness

I have always approached this sort of question with humor and a smile. “You mean, ‘Well, I probably work too hard?’” I then move on to some candid feedback and perspective. 

For example, “What some people consider a weakness, others may consider a strength. I have a hard time hiding my expressions when I am dealing with someone who is bogging down progress for the sake of wanting to look important. Some people would call that a positive—being candid—while others would call it undiplomatic.” 

I created a quirk list years ago. I’ve shared it with people when they join my team. There’s no reason to waste time, energy, and emotion trying to figure me out when I can give you the list. “Here I am. I’d be happy to share it with you.” That approach has always worked for me. If the interviewer doesn’t like that approach, then I probably shouldn’t be working there anyway.

Crafting the perfect response to “Why do you want to work here?” can set college students apart in job interviews. We’ve gathered insights from industry professionals, including a senior media relations specialist and a Chief People Officer, to share their best practices. From showcasing unique value to focusing on future contributions to the company, here are fourteen expert tips to help students make a memorable impression.

Showcase Your Unique Value

Convince them that they need you and not the other way around. Go in prepared to tell them your value and use proof of that. Start gathering and creating materials that will showcase that. 

My go-to response is, “I read that your culture is all about [positive aspect of culture] and that your team does [fun activity related to culture] on Fridays. Sign me up! I thrive in environments where collaboration feels more like hanging out with awesome people (who also happen to be brilliant). Plus, my [your quality that fits the culture] skills would be a perfect addition to the team!”—schmooze them!

Brittany Mobley, Senior Media Relations Specialist, Eastern Michigan University

 

Demonstrate Skills and Passion Alignment

To nail the “Why do you want to work here?” question, college students need to go beyond generic admiration for the company. The key is demonstrating alignment between their own skills, passions, and the company’s specific mission or projects. 

Do your homework: research the company thoroughly, pinpoint a recent initiative they’ve undertaken or a problem they’re solving that sparks genuine excitement in you. Then, connect this to your own aspirations, illustrating how your skills and interests can directly contribute to their goals. This level of research and self-reflection shows engagement and a sincere desire to be part of their team, not just any team.

Jyoti Tewari, Director HR, Webuters Technologies Pvt Ltd

 

Be Authentic and Connect Personally

Being an entrepreneur myself, I understand how stressful interviews can be—especially when you’re still in college and trying to land that first big gig. But when it comes to the classic “Why do you want to work here?” question, the best advice I can give is to just be real.

Don’t overthink it or try to feed them some rehearsed, buzzword-filled response you think they want to hear. That stuff rarely comes across as genuine. Instead, do your homework on the company beforehand. Dig into their values, their mission, the kind of culture they cultivate. Then, link that back to your own passions and strengths in an authentic way.

For example, if you’re interviewing at a cool tech startup, you could say something like, ‘I’ve been following your company’s work for a while now, and I’m really inspired by your drive to solve complex problems in innovative ways. As someone who loves tackling challenges with creative thinking, I’d be excited to be part of a team like yours that values fresh perspectives.’

The key is showing them you’ve put in the effort to understand what makes their company unique, and how that unique culture meshes with who you genuinely are as a person and professional. Done right, your response will flow naturally and help you stand out as someone who’d be a great fit, not just another college kid looking for any old job.

Zachary Bernard, Founder, We Feature You PR

 

Express Interest in Knowledge and Growth Potential

As a college professor, I think this is a great question and something I discuss with my students often. The student needs to express genuine interest in the opportunity and lay out the amazing opportunities to learn and grow from being awarded the position for which they have applied. 

The college student needs to express genuinely why they want to work at that particular company, beyond financial compensation, and how they will use all the knowledge gained to advance their careers.

Michael Wood, Consultant, Professor, Ottawa Consultants

 

Articulate Your Vision and Mission Statements

The most powerful answer to this question is stating your vision and mission statements. Your vision is what you want to bring to the world, and it is a big, bold statement. Your mission statement is how you are going to operationalize your vision. 

For example, my vision is that “all people have a job they love and earn the money they deserve.” My mission statement is “I am bringing my vision to the world by providing career guidance, innovating new job strategies, and writing books about job search.” If I am asked in an interview why I want the job, I state my vision and my mission and tie it to the critical job requirements of the job. Interviewers are blown away by candidates who have vision and mission statements and can be so specific about why they want a job based on those values.

As a college student, you probably have not defined your vision and mission statements. However, before reading this, were you aware you should have a vision and mission statement? Probably not, because most people don’t, even the most senior executives! So, begin to think of your vision and mission statements as they are today. Those statements can, and very likely will, change throughout your career, so don’t worry about being committed to a set of values now.

Eric Kramer, Career Management Consultant, Active Interviewing

 

Share a Personal Connection

Candidates can make a meaningful impression by sharing a personal connection to the company and/or their mission. Utilizing a life-experience-based anchor that drives your interest and passion will give the interviewer a more holistic understanding of your motivations and personality.

Aliza Dodge, Consultant, EC1 Partners

 

Convey Curiosity and Societal Impact

Craft a response that oozes curiosity and detective-like intrigue. Dive deep into the company’s ethos and paint yourself as a seeker of hidden truths within its walls. Show how your unique perspective can unveil untapped potential.

Then, infuse your answer with personal passion for societal impact. Share authentic stories of how your values align with the company’s mission, making it clear that you’re not just here for a job, but to make a meaningful difference. This blend of curiosity and purpose will set you apart and leave a lasting impression on interviewers.

Albert Varkki, Co-Founder, Von Baer

 

Research and Express Genuine Interest

First and foremost, it’s important to start by applying for roles that genuinely interest you. When you have a genuine interest in the position and the company, you’re more likely to invest the time and effort into thoroughly researching the company and providing an authentic and passionate answer to the question. 

To effectively answer this question, it’s crucial to devote time to gaining a comprehensive understanding of what they do and their core mission. Familiarize yourself with their values, products, and services, as well as any recent achievements or initiatives they have undertaken. Furthermore, delve into their company culture, work environment, and reputation within the industry. Immerse yourself in these aspects to gain valuable insights that will help you articulate your “why” in a quick and effective manner during the interview.

Heidi Hauver, Chief People Officer

 

Highlight Personal Connection to Mission

Tell them how the company’s mission resonates with you personally, perhaps through a story or an experience that highlights why their values matter to you. This shows you’re not just interested in any job, but you’re specifically keen on contributing to what they stand for.

A compelling approach is to highlight a personal connection with the company’s mission or projects. For instance, if applying to a company known for innovation in construction techniques, you might say, “I’ve always been passionate about innovative construction solutions. Your recent project X resonated with me because of its focus on sustainability and efficiency, aligning perfectly with my desire to contribute to impactful, forward-thinking construction projects.” This shows you’ve done your homework and genuinely care about what the company stands for.

Ana Alipat, Recruitment Team Lead, Dayjob Recruitment

 

Focus on Passion Beyond Pay

Answering this question honestly is important. And while the money you would get for working any job is an important aspect to consider, that probably is not what the interviewer wants to hear. So, saying something truthful about how the job you’re applying for is something you’re passionate about and something you’re excited to learn about is very useful.

Josh Pierce, School Counselor, Kearney Catholic High School

 

Flip Personal Goals to Company Benefits

In preparing the best response, it’s often most effective to identify what you, as the potential future employee, want to gain out of the work experience. Taking that idea and then flipping it to discuss what you’ll bring to the table and how that will benefit the company will set you up for responding with enthusiasm and genuine interest.

Desiree Smith, Director, Talent Acquisition

 

Mirror Interviewer’s Language in Response

As someone who’s interviewed dozens of college students, the responses to this question that have always stuck with me mirrored the language I used when describing the position and company.

For example, if I described the position as needing someone who can adapt quickly and wear many hats, a good response to the question “Why do you want to work here?” would be something like, “I’m looking for a fast-paced environment where I can develop my skills through variety, and the opportunity this company gives me to wear many hats is something I’m very interested in.”

It’s likely that this won’t be the first question you’re asked in your interview, so your interviewer often will have already described the position and expectations to you by the point they ask it. So while it’s good to have an answer prepared ahead of time, be flexible enough to incorporate some of the language the interviewer used earlier in the interview to stand out.

Alyssa DiCrasto, Brand Manager, Rate Retriever

 

Demonstrate Key Professional Traits

As an HR professional, I can tell you that interviewers are always looking for a few things, no matter the position or the industry. Those things are: that you can demonstrate you have initiative and company loyalty; you are solution-oriented and forward-thinking (that means when you have a problem, you attempt to find a solution before bringing the problem to your manager); you have a long list of accomplishments, rather than job tasks, to share during the interview and on your resume; and you can work in a team. 

During the entire interview, you should be focusing on these four things. Every answer you give should provide proof that you hold these credentials. This is important because if you can prove you have initiative, are solution-oriented, are goal-oriented (can achieve things), and can work in a team, what happened at your last employer won’t really matter to the prospective employer because you’ll make a good-looking candidate.

Catherine Mattice, Founder/CEO, Civility Partners

 

Focus on Future Contributions to Company

Hiring managers, by this point, are incredibly tuned into the transient worker. They know that there’s a very high chance that, despite identifying the perfect candidate, three to twelve months from the offer acceptance, the employee could very easily give their notice. 

Therefore, any well-crafted “why” response should focus on the future. Not necessarily five years—that in itself could seem disingenuous—but maybe talk about the sweet spot of one to three years. “I can see the current growth and can’t wait to see where the company can get to in two years, and how I can contribute.” Obviously, tailor it to the situation and what you actually think you’ll add to the company.

In preparation for your next job interview, we’ve gathered insights from top professionals, including HR executives and CEOs, to offer you the most effective strategies for researching a company. From analyzing employee social profiles to utilizing LinkedIn for company insights, explore the twelve comprehensive strategies these experts recommend for a deep dive into your potential employer’s world.

Analyze Employee Social Profiles
Observe Active Social Media Channels
Check Crunchbase for Financial History
Conduct Informational Interviews
Research Interviewers and Company Staff
Study the Company’s Digital Footprint
Review Website, Reports, and Employee Insights
Utilize Glassdoor for Candid Feedback
Leverage Official Channels and Employee Reviews
Read Between the Lines of Company Communications
Compare Company with Industry Competitors
Utilize LinkedIn for Company Insights

 

Analyze Employee Social Profiles

Drawing from my dual background as an HR professional with five years of experience and an HR writer with four years under my belt, I’ve developed a keen eye for assessing company cultures and work environments beyond the company’s LinkedIn page and traditional review sites like Glassdoor. 

A key strategy is to closely observe how employees discuss their work environment and culture on their personal LinkedIn profiles. This approach offers authentic insights into the company culture, beyond what is officially presented.

For instance, recurring mentions of overtime, burnout, or high stress levels among employees are clear red flags, indicating a potential culture of overwork. Conversely, posts celebrating team achievements, work-life balance, or professional development suggest a positive, supportive environment. Such nuances provide valuable, candid insights into the company’s real culture, guiding you toward making a well-informed decision about your potential workplace.

Maheen Kanwal, HR Executive, B2B Tech SaaS Copywriter, Founder, Call to Authority

 

Observe Active Social Media Channels

Assess the socials that they’re most active on so that you can really get a sense of what makes them ‘tick’, and what they’re likely to respond positively to. For example, if they have an office dog, then you can share your mutual love of dogs, or if they’re working on a certain project that they’ve shared, then you can comment on that project specifically.

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Check Crunchbase for Financial History

If you plan on working for a start-up, a scale-up, or a rapidly growing organization, I strongly recommend looking at Crunchbase to see their financial history. A great many privately owned companies survive almost entirely on venture capital, and the availability of this capital is paramount to their continued existence. 

Crunchbase outlines a company’s investment history, providing powerful insight into where the money is coming from. Consequently, when applying for jobs, it’s always worth keeping an eye on how much funding they have received, and for two reasons. Free-flowing funding means that salaries are likely to be paid as promised, as they are unlikely to run into financial problems in the short term. But also, if venture capital firms are interested in investing, this suggests the organization has something special going on, which is a positive sign.

Oliver Savill, CEO and Founder, AssessmentDay

 

Conduct Informational Interviews

One strategy I highly recommend for thoroughly researching a company before an interview is to leverage informational interviews with current or former employees. While online resources provide valuable information, speaking directly with individuals who have firsthand experience with the company can offer unique insights and perspectives.

Start by reaching out to your professional network or utilizing platforms like LinkedIn to identify individuals who currently work at or have previously worked for the company. Politely request a brief informational interview where you can ask questions about their experiences, company culture, values, and any other relevant aspects.

During the informational interview, focus on open-ended questions that encourage detailed responses. Inquire about the company’s mission, recent projects or initiatives, workplace environment, team dynamics, and growth opportunities. Additionally, ask about challenges they’ve faced and how the company addresses them, as well as any advice they have for potential candidates.

Listening attentively to their responses can provide valuable insights beyond what you might find in official company materials. Pay attention to recurring themes or sentiments, which can help you better understand the company’s culture and values.

After the informational interview, take notes and reflect on the information gathered. Compare it with other research sources, such as the company’s website, news articles, and employee reviews, to gain a comprehensive understanding.

Daniel Jorge, Senior Consultant, EC1 Partners

 

Research Interviewers and Company Staff

At the end of the day, companies are made up of people. It’s super important before an interview to do research about the people you’ll be speaking with. Just five minutes of Googling can do a lot… Look at their LinkedIn page (maybe you have connections or education in common) and find something interesting to discuss.

I’ve interviewed hundreds of people, and many don’t even look at our company website before speaking with us. Those that do just a little bit of research about the company and me really stand out and show they go the extra mile!

Corey Schwitz, CEO & Founder, On-Demand Salesforce, Hubspot and Revenue Ops Customization, Skydog Ops

 

Study the Company’s Digital Footprint

A unique strategy for researching a company thoroughly before an interview is to study its digital footprint beyond the traditional scope of its official website and social media profiles. This involves a deep dive into various online platforms and resources where the company’s indirect presence can provide insightful context about its culture, reputation, and operational nuances. Here’s how to approach this:

Participate in or review discussions on industry-specific forums and online communities related to the company’s field. These platforms can offer unfiltered insights into the company’s reputation within the industry, emerging challenges it might be facing, and the innovations it’s known for.

Websites like Trustpilot, Yelp, or even product review sections on e-commerce platforms can provide a wealth of information about the company’s products or services, customer satisfaction levels, and how the company handles complaints or feedback. This research can explain the company’s customer service ethos and product quality.

Companies in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, etc.) should check reports and filings with regulatory bodies. These documents can shed light on the company’s compliance history, financial health, and any regulatory challenges it may have faced. This information can be particularly insightful for understanding the company’s operational rigor and market standing.

Vaibhav Kakkar, CEO, Digital Web Solutions

 

Review Website, Reports, and Employee Insights

Before your interview, check the company’s website to learn about what it values and who leads it. Look at reports and financial statements for information on its finances and performance. Check news and social media for recent projects and how the company is perceived publicly. Read what employees say on sites like Glassdoor to understand how people feel about working there. 

Also, check LinkedIn for key people and connect with current or past employees if possible. This will give you a good understanding of the company, and during the interview, you can show that you know about its goals and values.

Eva Toledo, Senior Researcher, Kepler Search Pte Ltd

 

Utilize Glassdoor for Candid Feedback

I would highly recommend using Glassdoor or any other tool that will provide candid feedback about an organization. While organizations can pay to try to have bad reviews removed, the on-the-ground feedback and how an organization responds can show a lot.

In my consulting practice, I was burned by this previously. A client that I was going to work for had really bad reviews about the culture, the owner, and red flags that would have been a tip-off of things to come. However, I ignored the data in front of me. They turned out to be very much like the reviews, and I should have heeded the warnings. I ended up leaving the client after about six months.

Ben Madden, Owner, HR Action LLC

 

Leverage Official Channels and Employee Reviews

I highly recommend utilizing the company’s official channels, particularly its website and published materials. Start by reviewing the About Us, Mission Statement, and Values sections to grasp the organization’s foundational principles and culture. Examine annual reports and financial statements for insights into the company’s financial health and performance. 

Additionally, explore recent news articles, press releases, and social media profiles to understand current developments and employee interactions. Leveraging employee review platforms like Glassdoor can provide valuable perspectives on the work environment. Connecting with current or former employees on platforms like LinkedIn can offer firsthand insights. 

This comprehensive approach ensures that candidates not only understand the business’s objectives and financial standing but also its culture and employee experiences, facilitating a more informed and tailored interview preparation.

Steven Mostyn, Chief Human Resources Officer, Management.org

 

Read Between the Lines of Company Communications

The most important thing is to read between the lines on a company’s website and public communications to figure out what they really care about. Study their About page, press releases, leadership bios, and so on. Look for signs that they value innovation, people, or social responsibility in a way that appeals to you. Understanding what motivates a company will help the conversation flow better in interviews, beyond just your qualifications.

Additionally, check out news articles and reviews to get balanced inside perspectives from employees. Approach learning about a company as an interesting research project where no detail is too small. Doing this groundwork will allow you to assess if it’s a good fit, align values, and show how you can contribute.

I’ll admit I didn’t always do enough research early on and stumbled in interviews. But being your real self, focused on helping people more than profits, makes connections that the right organization will recognize.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-founder and CEO, EchoGlobal

 

Compare Company with Industry Competitors

One very effective tactic when researching the company you are about to interview with is not only studying the company’s history, products, services, and culture but also the company’s competitors to get a broader view of the industry and how the company stands against those competitors.

You can find company intelligence in industry reports, news articles, or in financial statements. This can help you to understand the competitive dynamics, current market trends, or present challenges. A good way to impress the interviewer can be to refer to their competitors and how they might be able to take account of this in the job you are applying for. It would show that you can think strategically and that you tend to be proactive.

An interviewer may ask you to describe some ways you might contribute to the company if you got hired. It’s a way of asking, “What can you do for us?” It can also be a way to determine your motivation and commitment to the company. Answering this question can help build your credibility and show the interviewer that you are excited to help the company grow. Some possible ways you might be able to contribute to the company that you’re interviewing for include bringing in new trends, being knowledgeable about the company, and being innovative.

Blake Smith, Marketing Manager, ClockOn

 

Utilize LinkedIn for Company Insights

LinkedIn provides a wealth of information about companies, including their mission, values, products or services, and recent news or updates. Additionally, you can explore the company’s culture page on LinkedIn, which often includes employee testimonials and insights into the work environment. 

Another valuable aspect of LinkedIn is the opportunity to leverage your professional network. If you know anyone, past or present, who has worked at the company, you can reach out to them for insights or information. 

Connecting with current or former employees can provide you with firsthand perspectives on the company’s culture, work environment, and overall experience. They may be able to share valuable insights that go beyond what you can find through public sources. This knowledge will help you prepare for your interview and demonstrate your genuine interest in the company.

"How to Answer ""Tell Me About Yourself"" for College Students | InterviewFocus",https://interviewfocus.com/how-to-answer-tell-me-about-yourself-for-college-students/,"How to Answer “Tell Me About Yourself” for College Students

Navigating the “Tell me about yourself” question in job interviews can be a pivotal moment for college students. We’ve gathered insights from twenty professionals, including HR managers and CEOs, to offer their best tips. From avoiding generic descriptors to preparing with mock interviews, these experts provide a roadmap for crafting a compelling personal narrative.

Avoid Generic Descriptors

As a regular interviewer (and I’m guessing others feel the same), generic words such as “passionate,” “reliable,” “motivated,” “conscientious,” and so on, just wash over you like white noise during an interview. You might as well save your breath. We know when candidates are telling us what we want to hear, and it can come across at best as a lack of imagination and is predictable at the very least.

I want to figure out for myself whether a candidate is passionate, reliable, or conscientious, so by giving me some specific background details or relaying a situation where they’ve demonstrated the kind of person they are, this really fleshes out that individual. For example, I want to hear:

what their passions are
what makes them tick
what gets them up in the morning
what stimulates and fascinates them

And the “whys?”

This tells me whether or not they’re the sort of person we need for the role. So, if they’re the kind of person who needs to be on the move—off scuba-diving, climbing mountains, or engaging in other physical adventures—then perhaps meticulous, focused editorial work wouldn’t be for them ultimately. However, if they tell me about their love and passion for words and their etymology, or their love of reading and how they get a real kick out of sublime sentence structure, then, bingo! You’ve got me interested.

And if my assumptions aren’t correct, then I need to be persuaded otherwise….

Of course, I’m interested in a candidate’s family life and the name and breed of their dog, but that can come later. What I really want to know is what attracted them to the position applied for in the first place. I can very quickly tell if they don’t really know about the job or the company, or have done no research whatsoever, and have simply uploaded their CV for a bit of job-fishing, so it’s imperative that they make it clear to me what they have in their personal repertoire or about their character that would make them a great fit for the company.

Anyone can pay lip service; believe me, it’s easy to do an unimpressive interview. Yet, it doesn’t take a huge amount of effort to stand out from the crowd, so my advice to any college student is to get yourself noticed and big up those unique traits that make you the perfect person for the job!

Lisa Tucker, Head of HR and Communications, Intellek

 

Be a Storyteller with Relevance

We get a lot of fresh college graduates for interviews at our legal process outsourcing company. Every time we conduct interviews or participate in college placement rounds, we allocate 1-2 minutes for the candidate to introduce themselves and the customary “tell me about yourself” session. 

We usually prefer a candidate to be more of a storyteller, as we know that a college student might lack practical knowledge of the actual process on which we work. We also prefer minimal usage of industry jargon and more real-life incidents, where the job responsibilities laid out in the recruitment offer are fulfilled or accomplished by the candidate through a personal incident, or any academic qualification. This gives a better peek into the skills of the candidate and shows how street-smart they are in applying college education to real-world problems.

I also prefer when college students read and research the job responsibilities prior to showing up at the interview. When a candidate weaves some keywords from the job description while responding to “tell me about yourself,” it sprinkles magic dust on their responses and makes their story more believable, further making them a potential future star at our company.

College students appearing for interviews should also try to demonstrate the impact of their work at any previous internship in quantifiable terms. For example, the contract drafting associate at our company told us that in one of her previous internships, she could speed up the teardown sheet preparation by 60%, resulting in reduced cycle time and improving the TAT for their final customers. 

The techniques described by her during the interview were relevant to the requirements we had, and she explained it in a quantifiable way while sticking to a storytelling tone. Her authenticity and lack of robotic recitations landed her a job at our company.

Aseem Jha, Founder and Head of Customer Delivery, Legal Consulting Pro

 

Show Professional Presence

Start your answer by saying, “As you may have read in my LinkedIn profile…” to show professional presence, and be sure that your profile fits the jobs you are pursuing and answers how you excel at what you do. 

Then work into your reply to the interviewer(s), “I reviewed your profile and would like to ask you a few questions as they relate to my career path, from your experience.” Watch them sit up straight because no one does this! And you will stand out for it.

Marc W. Halpert, LinkedIn Coach, Trainer, Marketing Consultant, connect2collaborate.com

 

Transition from Basics to Aspirations

When asked, “Tell me about yourself” in a job interview, start by quickly covering the basics like your hometown, university, and major, ideally within a minute. The key tip here is to then seamlessly transition into a deeper dive of your interests and professional aspirations. Let your personality fly! Talk about what drew you to your major, which career path(s) interest you, or the types of learning experiences you’re looking for. You can also tie in extracurriculars and share what relevant skills they have helped you build.

For example, you could say, “My name is Katie, and I’m graduating from Boston College this spring. I’m originally from Texas and came to Boston to study marketing. I’ve interned at two software companies over the last three years, helping each organization build out their social media and email marketing strategies. I love marketing because it’s the perfect blend of writing, psychology, and design, and I’m looking for a role that allows me to explore all three of these areas. This social media strategist role especially caught my eye because I’ve built a significant Instagram following for my food blog, and I’m interested in using the skills I’ve learned there in a more professional setting. In my free time, I love exploring Boston’s food scene, performing in my college’s improv group, and reading romance novels!”

The goal here is to make your introduction memorable enough to stand out and open up various avenues for further discussion during the interview. This approach not only personalizes your opening but also demonstrates a clear link between your academic pursuits, personal interests, and the job you’re interviewing for, making you a much more relatable and compelling candidate.

Katie White, Content Marketing Manager, Centime

 

Structure Your Response Strategically

One key strategy for delivering this response is to structure it strategically and concisely.

You can start by summarizing your academic background and initiatives that match the requirements of the position. Emphasize your internships, part-time jobs, if there are any, or other activities that honed your skills. If you want to be more creative, you can inject an object that symbolizes your characteristics. This will leave a powerful impression on the interviewer.

Remember how critical it is to tailor your response to the particular job and company you’re applying for. This approach shows not only your suitability for the job but also your thorough understanding of the company.

Make sure that your response lasts only two to three minutes. This encourages follow-up questions, leading to a lively and insightful discussion about your potential.

Bianca Nagac, Marketing Manager, MVP Asia Pacific

 

Formulate a TMAY Elevator Pitch

Tell Me About Yourself, or TMAY as I like to call it, is a frequent opener from interviewers to get candidates talking about themselves.

A common way to formulate your TMAY is as follows:

My name is ________, and I am a (Profession/Level)

With expertise in (function or capabilities)

My strengths include (unique professional qualities)

Particular accomplishments or distinctions relevant to the position are:

I have worked for/with (type of organizations/industries)

I am now seeking a permanent, interim, or consultant role and would like to apply my skills in delivering for your organization.

Of course, you can adapt this for your own individual situation. Practice saying this out loud so that you can deliver it at the drop of a hat. Perfect for the beginning of an interview—in person, via Zoom, or on the telephone. Can also introduce yourself in a new situation. Keep it under 2 minutes.

Jane Ferré, Talent Management Strategist, Jane Ferré Coaching

 

Focus on Industry Engagement

It seems obvious, but this is something I didn’t know when I was in college. “Tell them what they want to hear” has become my new mantra.

If you’re a college student and you’re asked, “Tell me about yourself,” in a job interview, say this: “Honestly, I pretty much spend all my time learning about [the industry you’re applying to], but I need first-hand experience, which is why I’m looking at this job. This profession is something I’m very interested in, but the best way to learn is by doing.”

Here’s why this answer works: It shows you’re engaged with the profession and will probably do above-average work. It shows you’re interested, so you will work hard. Finally, it shows you’re a self-starter.

You may be asked, “What have you learned so far?” But, since you’re a college student, you won’t be expected to be an expert in the subject. What interviewers most want to hear is that you’re passionate, eager to learn, and eager to work.

Tell them what they want to hear.

Edward Sturm, SEO and Marketing Expert, Edwardsturm.com

 

Convey Fluency Over Content

When answering this question, the most important thing you need to convey is fluency. Employers want to know whether candidates have communication skills and whether a candidate can speak about themselves in a smooth, natural way. The content of your response isn’t the priority; it’s the delivery that your interviewer will be assessing. 

No one is expecting a college student to have decades of experience or highly developed workplace-relevant skills. Consequently, you don’t need to immediately start listing buzzwords or highlighting personal competencies; this isn’t the goal of the question. Instead, simply tell the interviewer about yourself, but with a particular focus on presenting that information fluently.

Chloe Yarwood, HR Manager, Test Partnership

 

Tell a Resonant “Why” Story

A great way to answer the question, “Tell me about yourself,” is by telling a story that explains your “why” and how it aligns with the company’s mission and values. Try to make the story interesting and avoid rambling. 

Above all, stay authentic. Don’t make stuff up to try and win over your interviewer. Do highlight the aspects of your backstory that you feel would resonate most, and show a little emotion without losing control.

Dennis Consorte, Digital Marketing and Leadership Consultant for Startups, Snackable Solutions

 

Showcase Proactivity and Eagerness

For obvious reasons, college students can’t be expected to have extensive work experience. Luckily, job history is not everything. Therefore, when asked, “Tell me about yourself,” college students should do their best to showcase their proactive attitude, motivation, and eagerness to learn.

Elaborate on the academic accomplishments you take pride in. It’s good to mention membership in student organizations, internships, and volunteer work. Also, don’t be shy to talk about your interpersonal skills and character traits that could make you a valuable employee. After all, it’s often easier to train someone to do the job than to interact with people.

Last but not least, to make your answer both compelling and convincing for a recruiter, provide relevant examples illustrating what has shaped you the way you are and how you can use this experience in the position you’re applying for.

Agata Szczepanek, Community Manager, LiveCareer

 

Tailor Your “About Me” Response

When asked, “Tell me about yourself” in a job interview, shine by focusing on your strengths. Talk about something you’re good at that matches the job. Like, I talk about my internship where I made social media more popular by 30%. Numbers matter, and they remember that. 

Keep it short, connect your experiences to the job, and speak with excitement. It’s not just about saying what you did, but showing why you love it. Remember, it’s not reading your resume but telling a story about why you’re perfect for the job.

Joe Li, Managing Director, CheckYa

 

Craft a Concise Elevator Pitch

The “Tell me about yourself” question can seem like a loaded question because it is vague. You can’t give your entire life story to answer this question because that would take too long, but you also want to highlight your accomplishments, and you might have years of those. 

This question is also referred to as your elevator pitch. It is called this because to answer this question, you should only take about 20-30 seconds to answer, or about the time it would take to introduce yourself to someone if you are riding in an elevator with them.

For this question, follow this skeleton:

Introduce yourself: This could include your name, your current professional role, and academic background.

Objective or Goal: What are you seeking or looking to achieve? Are you going for a professional role, or admission into a school or internship?

Relevant experience and value: Highlight your strengths here. What sets you apart from others? This would be a great place for you to back that up with an example that is relevant to the context of your strengths.

Skills: Showcase your specific skills or qualifications that make you a good fit for the role. Focus on what you bring to the table for them.

Remember:

Don’t include unnecessary detail. If this is an interview, you can talk about the details as you answer other questions.
Exude passion in your communication. Show a genuine interest in the role or opportunity. Don’t forget to smile!
Practice. Practice answering this question as it is almost always going to be part of an interview, a networking event, a college fair, etc.

Mary Krull, SHRM-SCP, PRC, Lead Talent Attraction Partner, Southern New Hampshire University

 

Emphasize Skills and Aspirations

As an HR leader, with a sibling who’s currently a college freshman, I have discussed this topic quite a bit. The major piece of advice I stick to is to emphasize your skill set, aspirations, and goals. 

For instance, if applying for positions like a barista, cashier, or customer service agent, it’s essential to showcase how the skills acquired in these roles align with broader career objectives. For example, you can highlight organizational and multitasking skills as they relate to schoolwork and their relevance to the fast-paced nature of the job. 

This approach not only demonstrates suitability for the specific role but also conveys a strategic and forward-thinking mindset.

Brittney Simpson, HR Director, CallRevu

 

Deliver a Low-Risk Pitch

Keep in mind that when you’re asked a question, the person asking might actually mean something different from the words they’ve chosen to use. “Tell me about yourself” is often said by interviewers who aren’t well-prepared and might not even remember what job they’re interviewing you for. 

Give them an elevator pitch—maybe 30 seconds—about the role, why you feel you’re well-qualified, and how hiring you will be better for them than hiring any other candidate. You’re unlikely to know much about the others, but if you can convince the interviewer that you’re a very low-risk hire, you’re far more likely to get the job.

Steven Rothberg, Founder and Chief Visionary Officer, College Recruiter

 

Highlight Soft Skills with Examples

While you may lack considerable work experience, I recommend focusing on the skills you have gained through academic and extracurricular activities. A few examples of this kind of work include taking the helm at a club, volunteering, or working occasionally. 

Provide concrete examples to illustrate the importance of “soft skills,” such as collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. Consider sharing an example of a collaborative endeavor in which you served as team captain and overcame significant obstacles.

Cindi Keller, Communications Coordinator, The Criminal Defense Firm

 

Focus on Three Key Aspects

Try to focus on three things about yourself that you think they need to know. For example, “There are three things I think you’d want to know about me as it relates to this job: First, blah. Second, blah. Third, blah.” 

From there, you can end it with “I’m happy to dive into any of those, or I can expand on anything you had in mind?” Then you can pause. This shows you know your value, you’ve thought about how you can be valuable to their organization, and it focuses the conversation on something you know you’re good at.

Spencer Shulem, CEO, BuildBetter.ai

 

Share Your Major Choice

As a college student interviewing, potential employers are curious to understand motivation. Students should be able to thoughtfully answer the question, “Tell me about yourself,” by incorporating an answer affiliated with “Why did you choose your major?” 

By sharing the reason behind the choice of major, it provides a sense of the career path of interest and elicits your “why,” which is usually personal and relatable. It’s helpful to expand on this by explaining what led you to choose your major and, as a result, what you are looking to do next, which corresponds to the role you’re interviewing for (via background/interests), and demonstrates motivation for that particular arena. 

By providing a personal story, you are more likely to stand out as a candidate, be memorable, and therefore have a higher likelihood of receiving an offer. Furthermore, this demonstrates independent critical thinking, the ability to transfer academic knowledge into the work environment, and overall, communicate a sense of self-awareness.

Megan Dias, Career Services Coach, Parsity 

 

Blend Personal and Professional

When college students are asked, “Tell me about yourself,” in a job interview, my key tip is to craft a response that’s a blend of personal insights and professional aspirations, tailored to the job they’re applying for. This question is often the interviewer’s way of gauging how well a candidate can articulate their story, linking their background, skills, and interests to the position and company.

For example, a student applying for a marketing role might start by briefly mentioning their major and a personal trait that drew them to marketing, such as a love for storytelling or creativity. Then, they can highlight a relevant project or internship experience, explaining how it solidified their interest in the field and developed specific skills related to the job. Finally, they should express enthusiasm about how this role aligns with their career aspirations.

This structured approach—personal introduction, relevant experience, and connection to the role—provides a concise yet comprehensive snapshot of the candidate, making their response memorable and engaging. It’s about painting a picture of who they are, what they’ve achieved, and how they see themselves contributing to the potential employer’s success.

Niclas Schlopsna, Managing Consultant and CEO, spectup

 

Communicate Passion for the Role

Aim to convey the level of passion that you have for your hobbies and the role itself. Really strive to show that you can communicate that level of passion effectively, and how it will relate to the role itself.

Wendy Makinson, HR Manager, Joloda Hydraroll

 

Prepare with Mock Interviews

When you are in an interview, and you get this question, you may suddenly draw a blank in responding to it. This is why conducting mock interviews is a crucial preparation step. It helps you become aware of potential questions that may be asked, and it gives you time so that you will be adequately prepared to answer these questions. Ahead of the interview, do a bit of self-reflection and assess your hobbies and factors that make you the person you are. 

Then, you should try to find a way to highlight these aspects of yourself and how they relate to your work and career passions. You would be surprised at how your hobbies and daily tasks influence your goals and aspirations, and vice versa. When you are doing the mock interview, make bullet points so that it will be easier to digest and remember for the interview.

Embrace Your Unique Story

When it comes to job interviews, don’t be afraid to embrace your uniqueness. You bring a blend of experiences, skills, and perspectives that no one else can. Remember, your individuality is your greatest asset, and only you can tell your story. Confidently and transparently share how your unique qualities will add value to the team.

After a long career in one profession, I decided I wanted to pivot in a completely different direction. It was important for me to reflect on what set me apart and how my skills aligned with the roles I pursued, even though the career path was very different. I was able to show up to interviews being true to myself while confidently sharing my unique narrative and how it complemented the organization I was hoping to join.

It’s not just about fitting into a role; it’s about showing how the role fits you.

Komita Liggans, ACC, Coach and Content Creator, GK Liggans

 

Highlight Your Personality via Storytelling 

As an experienced recruiter, my top tip for candidates aiming to maintain authenticity and be themselves during a job interview is to focus on storytelling.

Share real-life examples from your experiences, emphasizing challenges you’ve overcome and achievements you’re proud of. By weaving narratives into your responses, you not only provide concrete evidence of your skills but also allow your personality to shine through. Be genuine in your communication and ‌share the lessons you’ve learned from both successes and setbacks.

This approach not only showcases your professional capabilities but also ensures that the interviewer gets a true sense of who you are and what you bring to the table.

Hanna Borysenko, HR Director, Elai Inc.

 

Balance Professionalism With Authenticity

I know you can feel pressured to be super professional in an interview. And sure, an interview is definitely a performance where you need to bring your A-game. But it’s also important to be yourself. (Or at least bring the parts of your personality that you want to bring into your professional life.) Why? Because if you land this job, you’ll be doing it for 5 days a week, 8 hours a day (at least!). If you’re some fake version of yourself in a job interview, and they hire that version of you, now you have to keep showing up playing that character!

You can decide how authentic to be in an interview. But if there are parts of your personality that you need to express while working, it’s okay to show that in your interview. For me, that’s humor. If jokes aren’t welcome in your office, I don’t want to be there, either. So you can bet I’ll try to make a joke in an interview to see how that lands! So my tip? Start by giving yourself permission to be authentic.

Pat Fligge, Director of Temple Professional Network, Temple University

 

Make Connections Through Vulnerability

Sharing moments of vulnerability, when appropriate, such as discussing challenges you’ve faced and how you’ve overcome them, can help you feel more like yourself. When you discuss challenges you have faced in your past jobs, it can help you make more meaningful connections with those who are interviewing you. 

Always maintain professionalism and focus on the lessons learned and growth achieved through those experiences, and share this with them as well. It can show your determination and critical-thinking skills, which are helpful during an interview!

Renan Ferreira, Head of Communications and Director of Sales, RealCraft

 

Practice Authenticity, Dismiss Doubts

When under stress, it’s challenging to let our true personality shine through, which is particularly problematic during job interviews. Practice, however, makes perfect. The more interviews you participate in, the easier it becomes to be transparent. 

To prepare for showing your honest self, consider seeking a voice coach who specializes in “elevator pitches.” Rehearsing your answers to typical questions in the mirror, much like actors do, will boost your confidence. Nerves can also stem from “impostor syndrome,” the feeling of not being qualified for the position. It’s important to dismiss such doubts, build self-assurance, and concentrate on the reasons why you are the right fit for the job. 

If there is a skill you lack, be upfront about it and have a plan for how you will address this gap. Remember, interviewers have a challenging task, and a brief acknowledgment of your appreciation for the opportunity to meet can help to break the ice and make a positive initial impression.

Lilia Koss, Community Manager, Facialteam

 

Candidly Discuss Growth Areas

One tip for showing authenticity is by being candid about your limitations. It shows you have a realistic understanding of yourself and are ready to keep growing, which is highly valued in any professional environment. When discussing areas for improvement, I recommend framing them in learning and development. 

For example, if there’s a skill you might lack, mention how you’re actively and practically working on it. This approach will highlight your honesty and also a proactive attitude toward self-improvement. However, it’s important to balance this by also discussing your strengths and how they align with the job’s requirements. This demonstrates self-awareness and a strategic mindset, which prove that you’re both aware of your limitations and also focused on leveraging your strengths effectively.

Bayu Prihandito, Certified Psychology Expert, Life Coach, Founder, Life Architekture

 

Foster Genuine Connection with Self-Awareness

Focus on genuine self-awareness and honesty. Employers appreciate and respect authenticity and just want to get to know the real person behind the resume. 

If your career has evolved unconventionally, or you’ve had to take a career break for personal circumstances, be honest. Avoid giving rehearsed or overly polished answers; instead, speak from the heart. Use your own words, and let your personality shine through in your responses. 

By establishing a genuine connection with the interviewer and showing a genuine interest in the company and the role, you’ll leave the interview knowing that you have been true to yourself. If you are the right fit for the company, the employer will recognize it.

Katharine Gallagher, Founder, Personal and Professional Growth, katharinegallagher.com

 

Trust Your Intuition

Follow your intuition. Pay attention to your gut feelings about the job and the people interviewing you. If something doesn’t feel right, it may not be the right fit for you. Celebrate that self-awareness rather than turning it into a frustrating moment or feeling like you wasted time. Realize that each interaction is getting you closer to where you belong.

Kelli Anderson, Career Coach, Texas General Insurance

 

Avoid Guessing Interviewer’s Mind

The trick to authenticity in interviews is to avoid turning the interview into a Keynesian beauty contest.

A Keynesian beauty contest is a hypothetical beauty contest where judges are rewarded for choosing the most popular faces among other judges, not necessarily those they find most attractive. The economist John Maynard Keynes likens this situation to investors buying securities which they believe others will invest in, rather than securities that have intrinsic value.

Consequently, when an interviewee attempts to tell the interviewer “what they want to hear,” they are ignoring their authentic self and are simply trying to second-guess the interviewer’s criteria.

Instead, you should answer questions in a way that feels effective to you, not what you suspect may be effective to your interviewer. This way, you can focus 100% of your attention on providing good responses while staying true to who you are.

Ben Schwencke, Business Psychologist, Test Partnership

 

Assess Mutual Fit Honestly

During a job interview, consistently remind yourself that this is a mutual evaluation process. Recognize that the interview is not just about convincing the employer that you are the right addition to their team; it’s also about assessing whether the company and team align with your values and career goals. 

Throughout the interview process, focus on responding in the most genuine and truthful manner. Avoid the temptation to provide answers that you think the interviewer wants to hear. Instead, share your genuine experiences, skills, and perspectives that are relevant to the position. This will not only allow the interviewer to get a true sense of who you are and the value you bring to their team, but it will also help you determine if the role and company are right for you.

Heidi Hauver, Chief People Officer

 

Prepare for Natural Conversation

Being yourself is great for helping your interview manager recognize you as a person. However, it doesn’t equate to admitting that coming late is your routine; this is plainly an unprofessional attitude. Be authentic in your role and expertise so that it doesn’t put overwhelming pressure on you when you join the company. 

The key to being genuine with your manager is to avoid over-preparing for the interview. The massive storage of already prepared responses will push you away from exposing your inner being for work. Canned responses will put you at risk of responding like a robot. Prepare in general—for example, look for the questions but don’t memorize them. You will allow yourself to flow with the conversation.

Janice Hawkins, Group Sales and Marketing Manager, Future Care Group

 

Showcase Your Side Hustle

My tip is to highlight your “side hustle.” Discuss a personal project or entrepreneurial endeavor you’re passionate about outside of your main career. This not only showcases your authenticity but also your drive, creativity, and the ability to balance multiple commitments. It demonstrates that you’re a well-rounded professional with a genuine passion for your work, both inside and outside the traditional business sphere.

Josh Ladick, President, GSA Focus

 

Lead With Your Values

When preparing for an interview, it’s important to define your values. Often, there’s a focus on leaving a positive impression, which can lead to altering one’s personality unintentionally. Leading with your values helps maintain authenticity.

For instance, if collaboration is a key value, frame responses to highlight collective successes with coworkers or problem-solving with other stakeholders. Being conscious of your values allows them to naturally influence your answers.

This approach is also useful for formulating questions for the interviewer. For example, asking, “I’ve found that collaboration is important to me in a work environment. As a remote-first company, how do you use technology to foster collaboration?”

Alex Lahmeyer, Founder and DEI Consultant, Boundless Arc

 

Connect as Individuals

Avoid giving generic answers that could apply to anyone, because if you sound and act like everyone else, you will come across as phony. Instead, focus on connecting with the interviewer as a person and enjoy the process. Smile. Speak with your hands. Show that you are delighted when answering their questions because you are enjoying the conversation.

Jeff Altman, Global Job Search Coach, The Big Game Hunter, Inc.

 

Arrive Early, Stay Composed

My advice is to ensure that you arrive early, with enough time to calm down and rehearse the main points you want to cover.

There’s nothing worse than feeling prepared and then having to rush on your way to the interview, which can often lead to being flustered and making mistakes that you otherwise wouldn’t!

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Back Claims With Evidence

Be prepared to have examples to back up claims of previous achievements or previous work. This doesn’t mean an extensive history, but rather, if you’re claiming to have achieved “x” or “y,” then it does help to have some form of evidence to support your claims.

Wendy Makinson, HR Manager, Joloda Hydraroll

 

Stay Honest, Remain Calm

Research shows that recruiters decide whether they want to hire you within the first 90 seconds of an interview. Chances are, they won’t delve deeply enough into your resume to care about minor exaggerations. 

However, most people become nervous about their lies being caught while the recruiter scans their resume. You may be caught in a lie if the recruiter focuses on something you exaggerated and questions you about it. Remaining calm and casual is the key to acing an interview, and the recruiter will notice a change in your demeanor. 

You’re much better off being honest. If you’re afraid of inexperience, shift the focus of the interview to your strong qualities.

Perry Zheng, Founder and CEO, Pallas

 

Use Humor to Ease Tension

Flipping the script usually helps set a better tone than the standard interrogation. The best way to do this, in my experience, is to acknowledge the awkwardness to the interviewers. 

I’ve had a potential hire crack a joke, starting with “I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve brought you all here today…” before explaining that he just wanted to clear the air a bit so we could all talk more normally. This was extremely impressive and very effective in managing a stressful situation, so I recommend this approach to others.

Dragos Badea, CEO, Yarooms

 

Take the Pressure Off Interviews

It sounds bad if I tell you not to take it too seriously, but—I would say that’s the number one thing that takes the pressure off. The best way to subvert the importance of an interview is to try to get another one. It’s like dating—if you’re only setting one date with one person, there’s too much riding on it. You want options, to take the edge off.

Do the same with job interviews—if you know there are options and alternatives waiting for you, you can afford to be more relaxed, more yourself. And ironically, you will perform much better when it’s not that serious.

Rick Berres, Owner, Honey-Doers

 

Be Comfortable in Your Clothes

One aspect that I think a lot of people don’t consider is being comfortable in your clothes. By this, I naturally don’t mean that you should show up to the interview in your pajamas; instead, you should wear your interview clothes for a few days ahead of time. 

Unless you’re regularly wearing a suit or formal wear, you’re going to be uncomfortable, and your body language will not be the same as usual. This does come through to the astute interviewer, so being comfortable in your formal wear is a great way to help you be yourself.

Onno Halsema, CEO, Contentoo

Standing Out from the Competition: 11 Unique Interview Follow-Up Ideas | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/unique-interview-follow-up-ideas/,"Standing Out from the Competition: 11 Unique Interview Follow-Up Ideas

To help you stand out in the competitive job market, we’ve gathered eleven unique follow-up strategies from top professionals, including CEOs and Senior IT Recruiters. From utilizing AI for personalized video messages to sharing a relevant article post-interview, these innovative ideas will help you differentiate yourself from other candidates.

Utilize AI for Personalized Video Messages

I use Maverick AI to send personalized video messages. I record a use case (I have several different ones for business development and one thanking for joining my talent community) video. Then, I give a quick recap of my most relevant experience and address any action items or any skills (software) I may not have had or weren’t strong with after having learned them. 

I let them know I’ve taken the initiative to bridge the skill gap and list what all I have learned to do and how to do those things. Video leaves an impression. The AI will swap out the first name of whoever you are addressing in the video using your voice, so you can record once but still send to Bob, Steve, and Frank, and each will see the same video but at the very beginning you will say their name to add that personalized touch. You can send 1,000 video links out per month for as low as $50-$100.

Matthew Jones, Senior IT Recruiter, VIP Staffing

 

Record a Thank-You Video

Surprisingly, candidates don’t always follow up after an interview, so doing so can really help you stand out. To differentiate yourself, consider recording a thank-you video. A short, 2-3 minute video message can add a more personal touch to your thank you and make a memorable impression for a hiring team navigating a full inbox. 

In your video, you can share that you enjoyed the discussion, express your appreciation for the hiring team’s time, reinforce your understanding of the role by summarizing key discussion points, highlight aspects of the role that align with your interests, skills, and abilities, and take some time to explain how you plan to contribute to the success of the company. 

You can finish your message by sharing your genuine enthusiasm for the position and let the team know that you are looking forward to hearing from them on the next steps.

Heidi Hauver, Chief People Officer

 

Add Value with Prompt Email Follow-Up

In my experience of interviewing thousands of candidates, it has always impressed me when they follow up. 

However, the truth is that very few candidates follow up. Therefore, doing so will not only differentiate your application but also give the impression that you are highly motivated. Being a more memorable candidate is even more important if an employer has many choices and is struggling to decide.

Prompt follow-up by email is recommended. Express gratitude for the employer’s time, convey that it was a pleasure to meet them, and express your interest in the job. If the employer mentioned further assessments or meetings, reiterate that you’re keen to complete these at their earliest convenience.

Last, you may wish to add value like: “During our conversation, you mentioned [Challenge/Objective]. I’ve been thinking about it and wanted to share some thoughts on how I could contribute…”

Geoff Newman, Founder, Starget.co.uk

 

Create a Relevant Mini-Project

In a hyper-competitive talent research sphere, it’s not just skills that set you apart, but the nuances of your approach post-interview. 

One intriguing method would be to craft a bespoke mini-project or short analysis pertinent to a challenge mentioned during an interview faced by the prospective company. Rather than a traditional thank-you note, send a succinct presentation or document that demonstrates your proactive approach to problem-solving. This not only exhibits your initiative but offers a tangible glimpse of the value you’d bring.

Moreover, integrate feedback or insights from the interview into this project. This showcases your attention to detail, active listening skills, and eagerness to adapt, making you a memorable candidate in a sea of conventional follow-ups.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-Founder and CEO, EchoGlobal

 

Send a Personalized Book Recommendation

After my interview, I sent the interviewer a personalized book that resonated with our discussion, accompanied by a note explaining its relevance and how it reflected my perspective on the role. This thoughtful gesture not only underscored my commitment and passion but also provided a tangible representation of my values and approach, setting me apart as a candidate who goes the extra mile.

Rob Blum, CEO, Blumsafe

 

Provide Recruitment Process Feedback

If you’re determined to get a job after the interview, any respectable company would appreciate your feedback on the recruitment process. 

Sending your opinion about it might seem risky and controversial. However, we need to remember that modern companies’ values are based on the culture of feedback. Sharing your ideas proves your familiarity with the job market’s values. It will also present you as a confident and outspoken person, aware of their competencies. Make sure your language is professional, but avoid being too authoritative. Of course, you should consider such a move only if you have positive feelings about how you were approached as a candidate. 

In other words, balance your expertise with humility. Address various steps of the recruitment process to prove your engagement and dedication to it. Only some candidates summon up the courage to adopt this strategy, so you will undoubtedly set yourself apart from the competition.

Martyna Szcześniak, Community Expert, MyPerfectResume

 

Polish Interview Answers Post-Interview

Consider showcasing your dedication to ongoing growth and refinement to set yourself apart from other candidates. Specifically, revisit the questions that were asked during the interview and provide more polished answers after thoughtful consideration through a follow-up email. 

This approach not only underscores your genuine interest in the position but also highlights your ability to adapt and continually enhance yourself. Demonstrating your commitment to self-improvement and reflective thinking can make a lasting impression on the hiring team.

Trendy Tan, Marketing Senior, Kepler Search

 

Include Relevant Project in Follow-Up

Distinguishing yourself in your follow-up after a job interview all depends on the seeds you planted during the interview itself. During the interview, find the right time or steer the conversation towards a specific project you completed that showcases your skills and experience. 

During your email follow-up, you can include links or attach your project so that the interviewer can learn more. This will create a lasting impression as it provides direct evidence of your qualifications.

Adam Shlomi, Founder, SoFlo Tutors

 

Summarize the Interview in Follow-Up

One time, I actually received a summary of the interview, which kind of blew my mind as it was over an hour long and touched on quite a few subjects. The thank-you email basically summarized everything we discussed and even included some additional clarifications beyond what was said to shore up some points in their resume and experience. 

It clearly took quite a lot of work, not to mention a prodigious memory and set of communication skills, so it really stuck in my mind.

Dragos Badea, CEO, Yarooms

 

Send a Handwritten Thank-You Note

One unique way to make a lasting impression post-interview is by sending a handwritten thank-you note. It showcases gratitude and illustrates your dedication and the extra effort you’re willing to put in. 

While it might seem old-fashioned, such a gesture stands out precisely because of its rarity. Receiving a physical note in an age of digital communication can leave a significant impact, making you memorable in the eyes of the interviewer. This personal touch can set you apart from other candidates and demonstrate your genuine interest in the position.

Michael Sena, CEO and Lead Analytics Consultant, Senacea Ltd.

 

Share a Relevant Article Post-Interview

One creative or unique idea for following up after a job interview is to find an article that relates to something that was talked about in the interview. 

The next step could be to send a note that says something along the lines of: “I came across an article today that reminded me of the discussion we had around X. I’d love to know your thoughts.” 

This approach is a great way to stay top-of-mind, provide something of value to the interviewee, and to follow up without the typical “I wanted to follow up” email.

College Assets Unveiled: Skills and Knowledge that Transformed Business Leaders' First Jobs | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/knowledge-that-transformed-business-leaders-first-jobs/,"College Assets Unveiled: Skills and Knowledge that Transformed Business Leaders’ First Jobs

To help you understand the value of college skills in the professional world, we asked fifteen professionals, including founders and a VP of Marketing, to share their experiences. Their insights range from the importance of effective communication in software programming to the necessity of writing skills in the corporate world.

Effective Communication in Software Programming

I’m excited to share my experience from my first job, and the skills I acquired during college that helped me along the way.

Effective communication was the most valuable skill for my first job. College activities like group projects and presentations fine-tuned my ability to convey ideas clearly, which has been pivotal in my career. 

As a software programmer in my corporate job, this skill proved indispensable. For instance, when tasked with explaining a complex software product to a non-technical audience, my communication skills enabled me to simplify intricate details into understandable content. 

Also, my communication skills helped me collect feedback and collaborate effectively, enhancing the quality of my work and bolstering client relationships. All these communication skills that I acquired during my college days laid a solid foundation for my successful career.

Vidya Soman, Founder, Resume Guardian

 

Soft Skills as a Key to Professional Navigation

During my college years, I pursued a degree in Communications, which exposed me to a range of courses focused on soft skills such as self-awareness, empathy, diversity, and leadership development. Little did I know at the time that these skills would become some of the most valuable assets in my first job and subsequent professional career. 

One crucial lesson I’ve learned from my college education is the importance of valuing soft skills and having confidence in their long-term impact. In a workplace often plagued by imposter syndrome, where individuals doubt their abilities because of a perceived lack of experience, these soft skills have been my most beneficial assets. They have not only allowed me to excel in my role but have also empowered me to navigate complex professional situations with confidence where technical skills aren’t enough.

Anna Thiele, Leadership Strategist, Deliberate Directions

 

Mastering Sales as a Universal Skill

The best skill that absolutely everyone must master is selling. Everything is sales—whether you’re selling yourself to an employer, or an idea to a client or investor. 

Learning how to sell wasn’t part of the college curriculum, and that held back many opportunities because there was a belief that the work was good enough to speak for itself. It took years of resisting, and then finally investing, to learn how to sell without selling. Now, there’s no discomfort when selling services. The focus is to serve—but more importantly, the language used attracts dream clients and projects effortlessly.

Average people will advance quickly in their careers (and finances) simply because they are masterful sellers. Whatever the field of study, learning how to sell is crucial!

Anastasia Gerali, Clinical Hypnotherapist and Abundance Life Coach, Art of Aligned Living

 

Cultivating Relationships From College to Career

I learned the importance of cultivating relationships with mentors in college. Professors and upperclassmen were the reason I could succeed and accomplish my goals. In my first job, I prioritized building relationships with my managers, on top of making sure I was performing well. These relationships were a huge support in the steep learning curve I experienced in the first couple of months, and their advice and experiences gave me clarity on my own possible career trajectory within the company.

Adam Shlomi, Founder, SoFlo Tutors

 

Music Technology Knowledge Boosts Sales

During my college years (1980s—I’m old), I was deeply immersed in music technology and hi-fi systems, fueled partly by a part-time job at a music warehouse. This passion often led me to focus more on the mixing desks at concerts than the performing bands themselves. The intricate nuances of sound engineering and device connectivity fascinated me. When I landed my first job as a salesman at a hi-fi chain in London, this specialized knowledge became an invaluable asset. 

My understanding of how audio systems connected and functioned allowed me to excel in my role. I could quickly ascertain customers’ needs and offer them tailored solutions that improved their audio experiences. This wasn’t just about pushing products off shelves; it was about building trust and delivering value, boosting sales and fostering customer loyalty. The blend of my technical expertise and genuine passion enabled me to excel in a role that many others might have just seen as a transactional process.

Shane McEvoy, MD, LeadFly

 

Time Management as a Writer’s Lifeline

Being a writer was my first job, and it still is. Time management was the most beneficial skill in my first job. Yes, it’s a very generic one, but I personally gained this skill nowhere but during my college years. I remember doing multiple course assignments every day with excruciating deadlines, not forgetting that I also had to balance my academic performance with organizational experiences. 

Time management has helped me survive my first job and excel in my role to where I am now. I learned to organize work and time perfectly. As a writer, I must count how many hours I spend on different writing projects. I also need to deliver quality results promptly. That’s why if I can’t balance my time, I’ll be prone to burnout and easily get trapped in writer’s block. Fortunately, that’s not the case, thanks to time management skills.

Diana Royanto, Writer, Milkwhale

 

Critical Thinking in Marketing Analysis

One skill I gained during college that was most beneficial in my first job was critical thinking. This skill helped me excel in my role as it allowed me to analyze complex problems, evaluate different perspectives, and make informed decisions. 

For example, in my role as a marketing analyst, I was tasked with analyzing market trends and consumer behavior to recommend strategies for our products. By applying critical thinking, I could identify new opportunities and propose innovative solutions, which ultimately contributed to the company’s success.

Lee Odierno, Personal Injury Lawyer, The Odierno Law Firm, P.C.

 

Resilience From College All-Nighters to Startups

I think back to my college days; the most invaluable skill I picked up wasn’t a coding language or a business strategy—it was resilience. Remember those sleepless nights cramming for finals? Or those group projects where no one seemed to be on the same page? They taught me to navigate through challenges and keep pushing forward.

In the early days of my startup, when we were just a team of five cramped in a tiny basement, our first software crashed more times than I care to admit. But instead of giving up, I’d remember those college all-nighters and think, “If I could get through that, I can get through this.” Our bounce-back attitude became our company’s DNA. Did you know that, according to a report, 70% of startups face significant setbacks in their first year? Yet, only those with grit and resilience, like that developed during challenging college experiences, truly flourish.

Ankit Prakash, Founder, Sprout24

 

Project Planning From Thesis to Workforce

One of the most important skills I learned as a student was project planning. This really helped me in my first job out of college, which was a research and writing role that came with a lot of personal responsibility and independent work. 

Because my college required us to spend one year working on an undergraduate thesis, I was able to practice research planning, creating achievable timelines, and organizing and prioritizing tasks. This made it so much easier to handle the transition from being a student to entering the workforce and allowed me to excel in my first job.

Eva Chan, Certified Professional Resume Writer (CPRW) and Senior Content Specialist, Resume Genius

 

Adaptability as a Call-Center Agent’s Asset

As an English philology student, I developed decent adaptability skills during college. The main reason for that was the international environment, as my professors and other students came from different parts of the world and represented different cultures. I also participated in a student-exchange program and spent a few months in Spain.

Adaptability has been greatly helpful in my work life ever since, starting from the first job I got. I worked as a call-center agent, and my duties involved renewing mobile-phone contracts. Thanks to precious experience from college and adaptability skills, I excelled in the given role. They helped me tailor my approach to various clients and circumstances. I also found it easy to adjust my communication style to the person I was talking with. 

As a result, I was successful—clients wanted to speak to me, managers were happy, and the job satisfied me.

Agata Szczepanek, Community Manager, MyPerfectResume

 

Public Speaking as a Legal Career’s Foundation

An invaluable skill I honed in college was the ability to confidently speak in front of an audience. Far from a mere academic drill, these classroom presentations laid the groundwork for my legal career. They taught me how to structure my thoughts clearly, navigate unexpected questions, and simplify complicated concepts. 

This skill set has proven to be indispensable in my work, especially in courtrooms and client consultations—where clear, impactful communication often tips the scales between success and failure.

Alex Freeburg, Owner, Freeburg Law

 

Work Ethic as a Designer’s Inspiration

The one thing I took from college that was the most beneficial to my first job was the importance of a strong work ethic. This actually came from a work-experience placement I had in London during my degree, where I met two other design students creating amazing motion-graphics work as a team. 

Seeing how hard and how efficiently they worked was truly inspiring, and it opened my eyes as to how if you want to create great work, you have to be prepared to put the effort in and be relentless in your pursuit of producing something special. It took me up a level as a designer—I started thinking bigger, working harder, and achieving more. 

Obviously, there’s a limit to how many hours we can put into things, but generally, this helped change my mindset and put me on a path to becoming a better designer.

James Sanderson, Creative Director, EverydaySomething

 

Task Management and Prioritization in Marketing

The skill of effectively managing tasks and setting priorities, honed during my college years, played a pivotal role in my initial job. This ability allowed me to seamlessly transition into the professional world and excel in my position. For instance, in my first job as a junior marketing analyst, I handled many projects simultaneously. 

By applying the organizational and prioritization skills I acquired in college, I could systematically assess each project’s importance, deadlines, and impact on the company’s objectives. This enabled me to allocate my time and resources efficiently, ensuring that critical tasks received immediate attention while managing less time-sensitive responsibilities. 

Consequently, I consistently met deadlines, contributed to successful marketing campaigns, and demonstrated my value as a reliable and productive team member.

Hilary Kozak, VP of Marketing, LivSmooth

 

Language Mastery in SEO Optimization

One of the most valuable skills I gained in university was mastering multiple languages. This proficiency proved advantageous when I became an SEO specialist. We often optimized web content for different regions, and understanding language nuances was crucial. 

Accurate translation and implementation of SEO keywords in various languages improved our site’s visibility in non-English markets. This expanded our customer base and boosted website traffic. My linguistic skills from college were instrumental in my success as an SEO specialist.

Kseniia Mykolaienko, CMO, Parentaler

 

Writing Skills as a Corporate World Necessity

Writing! The corporate world is full of correspondence, especially emails. Being able to compose a well-written email or any other correspondence can go a long way, from getting the job to performing in your roles, and beyond. Having great communication with your team, clients, or anyone else can significantly advance your career.

What Questions Should I Ask a Product Owner in an Interview? | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/what-questions-should-i-ask-a-product-owner-in-an-interview/,"From checking for Scrum experience to understanding how they overcome challenges, here are 11 answers to the questions, “What are a few effective questions to ask a product owner in an interview, and why?”

 

Do You Have Experience Working With a Scrum Framework?
What is Important About Research and Validation?
How Do You Measure the Success of Your Product…?
Who Is the Most Significant Product Stakeholder?
How Do You Prioritize Product Backlog?
How Do You Stay Up-to-Date on Industry Trends and…
How Can You Avoid Being a Bottleneck for a Scrum Team?
What Do You Think About Our Current Product?
How Do You Balance Trade-offs Between Key Stakeholders?
Can You Define the Product Owner Role?
Describe a Challenge You’ve Had With an Executive 

 

Do You Have Experience Working With a Scrum Framework?

In my experience as an interviewer for product owners, I always find one question particularly telling: “Do you have experience working with a Scrum framework?” As Agile methodology and Scrum become increasingly popular in working environments, being able to work within the Scrum framework is essential for being an effective product owner. 

The answer to this question can provide insight into both their technical aptitude and focus on results: people with a background in Scrum are well-organized, relentless goal-setters capable of foreseeing potential outcomes. Of course, there are other questions that can help determine if the candidate is suited to be a product owner, but this one is definitely one of the most important.

Antreas Koutis, Administrative Manager, Financer

 

What Is Important About Research and Validation?

As a product owner myself, I like to ensure that my team members clearly understand the importance of research and validation. One question I like to ask is, “What is the most important thing to remember about research and validation?” This question pushes the candidate to reflect on their own experience and gives me insight into their experience in a role that I value highly.

Matthew Ramirez, CEO, Rephrasely

 

How Do You Measure the Success of Your Product…?

When interviewing a product owner, one question I always ask is, “How do you measure the success of your product, and what metrics do you use?” 

This question allows you to understand their product management approach and gives insight into how they measure success. It helps you evaluate if they have the knowledge and experience to be a good fit for your company and gives you insight into whether they are using the right KPIs, as well as their ability to analyze and interpret the data. 

If possible, I like to get specific answers from candidates on what metrics they use, how often they track these metrics, and what actions they take based on them. If a candidate can’t provide specifics about their process, then this is a red flag that something may be wrong with their product management approach.

Shaun Connell, Founder, Writing Tips Institute

 

Who Is the Most Significant Product Stakeholder?

In an interview with a potential product owner, it is important to ask questions to assess their understanding of the role and ability to manage complex projects. One effective question that can help evaluate the candidate’s product management capacity is, “Who do you believe is the most significant product stakeholder‌?” 

This question will provide insight into how the prospective product owner perceives stakeholders and their involvement in product development. Not only will this answer provide valuable information about their technical and managerial skills, but it can also reveal key traits, such as adaptability and resourcefulness in managing different stakeholders.

How Do You Prioritize Product Backlog?

One of the major challenges of every product owner is backlog prioritization. Customer, stakeholder, and team feature requests, as well as various bugs, can pile up quickly. Having a clear picture of the situation and the ability to prioritize accordingly is a key responsibility of a good product owner. 

A great product owner can show that they have complete control over the backlog, as well as the confidence to make hard decisions and say no to stakeholders when needed. They should also be able to choose or change how they track the product backlog to ensure the maximum productivity of their team.

Gordana Sretenovic, Co-Founder, Workello

 

How Do You Stay Up-to-Date on Industry Trends and…

“How do you stay up-to-date on industry trends and market changes, and how do you incorporate this knowledge into your product strategy?” Since staying informed about industry trends and market changes is crucial for success as a product owner, this question is worth asking during the interview. 

By understanding how a candidate stays updated and incorporates this knowledge into their strategy, you can gauge their ability to keep the product relevant and competitive in a rapidly changing market. 

This question also sheds light on how the person approaches market research and their capacity for compiling and analyzing data. It shows their ability to recognize and address market opportunities and difficulties, which are crucial components of the product owner’s job. By asking it, you test a candidate’s ability to stay ahead of the curve and make accurate decisions that drive the product’s success.

Nina Paczka, Community Manager, Resume Now

 

How Can You Avoid Being a Bottleneck for a Scrum Team?

I would ask: “As a product owner, how can you avoid being a bottleneck for a Scrum team?”

This question reveals a candidate’s ability to prioritize and focus on activities with the greatest impact on the product’s success, effectively manage their backlog, communicate with the team, foster a shared vision among team members, decide promptly, and understand how to handle dependencies.

Maryna Kucherova, Head of Product and Advisor, Elai.io

 

What Do You Think About Our Current Product?

There are many outstanding questions to ask during an interview. However, I believe this is the most important one: “What do you think about our current product? Why?”

It will have you find out if they even checked it out, did their research, and how they feel about it. If they have not checked out your product, that would be a no-go for me. It will give you great insights into their thoughts and where you could improve if they did. 

It makes the question relevant to your product, dives into the willingness of the person wanting the job, and gives insight into what kind of value they can bring. You can dive deeper with questions like:

 Can you explain our target market and user needs for our current product?
 How would you measure the success of our product and track its performance over time? 

If you keep things relevant to your product, it might give you some new insights. Especially when you do more interviews, it will provide you with new ideas.

Joran Hofman, Founder, Reditus

 

How Do You Balance Trade-offs Between Key Stakeholders?

“Can you describe a time when you had to make a difficult trade-off between the needs of different stakeholders in a product development project, and how you resolved the situation?” 

This question can reveal the candidate’s problem-solving skills, decision-making ability, and experience in managing stakeholder expectations, which are all important qualities for a product owner. 

A good product owner needs to balance the interests of various stakeholders, such as customers, management, development teams, and business partners, to ensure that the product meets the needs of the target market while staying within the constraints of the project. 

By sharing a specific example, the candidate can show their ability to handle complex situations, communicate effectively, and find creative solutions to overcome obstacles.

Luciano Colos, Founder and CEO, PitchGrade

 

Can You Define the Product Owner Role?

How an applicant answers this question will say a lot about their knowledge and exposure to the interviewer. Product owners are primarily responsible for the maximization of the value of their product, so that should be a significant factor in their answer. They also prioritize and organize the team’s work, backlog, and act as a proxy for customers.

Alexandre Robicquet, Co-Founder and CEO, Crossing Minds

 

Describe a Challenge You’ve Had With an Executive 

A significant question to ask a product owner in an interview is, “Describe a challenge you’ve had with an executive and how did you overcome the problem?” 

This allows the candidate to think about their experience and the challenges they have faced in their past roles, which can give the interviewer a better idea of how the candidate will handle similar challenges if hired. 

Additionally, it can also reveal how creative and resourceful the candidate is in working through problems, especially with senior leadership in the organization.

14 Ways College Seniors Can Get Ahead In Their Job Search | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/ways-college-seniors-can-get-ahead-in-their-job-search/,"How can college seniors get ahead in their job search?


To help you best prepare as a college senior for your job search, we asked recruiters, hiring managers and business leaders this question for their best insights. From building a strong resume to reaching out for informational interviews, there are several things college seniors should focus on to put them ahead of their peers in their job search after graduation.



Here are 14 ways these leaders recommend for college seniors to get ahead in their job search:
Build a Strong Resume
Join Facebook Groups
Use Your Professors’ Network
Take Advantage of Internships to Gain Experience
Know What the Current Requirements Are
Engage in Several Activities to Add Value to Your Job Application
Research to Get Familiar With New Job Titles
Visit Job Boards to Understand Where to Locate Opportunities
Don’t Wait Until You Graduate to Start Applying
Learn About Your Future Career Through Internships
Build and Leverage Your Network
Send Out Customized Cover Letters
Create a Personal Website or Blog
Start Reaching Out for Informational Interviews

 

Build a Strong Resume

One of the best is by building a strong resume. A well-written resume can help you stand out from the competition and make it easier for employers to find your qualifications and skills. Make sure that your resume is tailored specifically for the position you’re seeking and be sure to include all of your experience and education relevant to this role. Include keywords that are specific to the company you’re targeting, as well as any evaluative comments or recommendations that may reflect positively on you. Remember also to keep things concise yet informative so that potential employers have enough information without having TOO much info overload!

Johannes Larsson, Founder and CEO, JohannesLarsson.com

 

Join Facebook Groups

Join Facebook groups for specific career paths. This is a great opportunity to connect with people in the industry or understand the skills and qualifications the path entails. For example, someone may post about an open role at their company, or you can create a post asking for any tips. It creates a community that can set you up for success before you enter the real world.

Chris Vaughn, CEO, Emjay

 

Use Your Professors’ Network

One way to stay ahead is to use your professors’ network. Your professors have likely been working in their field for many years and have built up a network of contacts. Some of these contacts may be looking to hire new graduates. By asking your professors for introductions, you can put yourself ahead of other job seekers who don’t have access to such a valuable resource. In addition, your professors can provide you with advice and guidance that will help you in your job search. So, if you’re looking for a way to get ahead in your job search, don’t forget to ask your professors for help.

Lorien Strydom, Executive Country Manager, Financer.com

 

Take Advantage of Internships to Gain Experience

One way for college seniors to get ahead in their job search is by interning. If you’re looking to secure a job after college, you’ll want to take advantage of any opportunity. This way you can build your resume and gain experience. Internships are always welcome, and the more experience the better! When you’re an intern, you get the chance to try out new things and see what kind of work you like best. You can also try out different types of companies and see which one suits your needs best. If it doesn’t feel right, there’s always another opportunity waiting for you!

Piotr Buczynski, SEO Researcher, PhotoAid

 

Know What the Current Requirements Are

When you’re looking for a job, it may sometimes feel like the talent pool is saturated and you’re getting nowhere. To rise above this struggle, do a deep dive into what recruiters are looking for and how you can get the training required to acquire these skills. When you have the necessary tools in your tool belt, you are more likely to stand out and thus, get ahead in your job search.

Igal Rubinshtein, Founder, Home Essentials Direct

 

Engage in Several Activities to Add Value to Your Job Application

Graduation season went by very fast this year. Today, we welcome the new batch of fresh graduates in the working industry. Amidst the sea of new graduates looking for a job, one can stand out by building an exceptional resumé. Before graduation, students can already begin joining different organizations and contests. Doing so can add more value to their application and portfolio. Fresh grads can also research the company’s culture to see if it fits their moral principles. The institution you choose to work for reflects your values and personality. Thus, one must always be careful in picking and pursuing a career.

Laura Martinez, Consultant and Content Writer, PersonalityMax

 

Research to Get Familiar With New Job Titles

The work market, especially in light of technological advancements, is changing at such a rapid rate that there are a ton of occupations out there that you’ve probably never even heard of, and which didn’t exist back when you were chatting with your school’s careers counselor. Have you ever heard of a user experience (UX) designer? What about a Growth Hacker, a Backend Developer, or a Content Marketer? It’s worth your time to look into it; once you get beyond the unfamiliar titles, you may discover that these are parts you’d like to test out. Taking a less well-trodden professional route can mean fewer people applying for the same jobs, giving you a better chance of standing out from the crowd and landing the job of your dreams.

Daniel Foley, Founder, Daniel Foley Consultancy

 

Visit Job Boards to Understand Where to Locate Opportunities

It’s not enough to want to work in a specific field – you need to know the current available job market. College seniors should begin focusing on a company or an internship program to start their careers. Visiting a job board can help you understand which geographic areas have those specific opportunities. Lastly, research how many different job offers are available and what type of experience is required, including asking for help from professors to provide references and a letter of recommendation.

Benjamin Earley, CEO, HOLT

 

Don’t Wait Until You Graduate to Start Applying

Start reaching out to HR early. Many big businesses build an influx of new graduates to the job market into their recruiting timelines, but the reality is that after graduation isn’t when you want to start being visible. That time of the year can be one of the most challenging for entry-level applicants, as they’re competing with a country full of other similarly experienced candidates. By getting in touch with recruitment at your target companies earlier in the year, you can build a relationship with the company before you even graduate. These reps may be able to give you a good idea of timelines for when to begin applying or point you in the direction of entry-level programs at their company.

Vimla Black Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO, Ourself

 

Learn About Your Future Career Through Internships

When I was in college I took a Summer internship during my sophomore, junior, and senior years. It did wonders for my industry connections and knowledge. Internships are great because you learn so many different aspects of your career. You learn what you are good at, what you need to work on, what you don’t care for, and real-life experience that can be put on a resume to get ahead in your job search. When you’ve already had an internship or two, you understand what companies in your field are looking for. Putting that type of information on your resume and shining those skill sets will get recruiters to notice. Internships build connections and sharpen skills. You never know what connection might help you land the job of your dreams after college.

Seth Newman, Director, SportingSmiles

 

Build and Leverage Your Network

The best way for college seniors to get ahead in their job search is to build and leverage their network. Connect with former mentors, professors, and co-workers on LinkedIn and reach out to them to ask for their advice and guidance. You want to make sure that you’re making a good first impression, so make sure that your profile is up to date and that you’re highlighting your best professional qualities. Keep in touch with them throughout your job search, and when you land a job offer, ask them for a referral to help you get your foot in the door.

Luciano Colos, CEO, PitchGrade

 

Send Out Customized Cover Letters

Send customized cover letters to employers of interest with your resume. This is a great opportunity to let your personality shine, as well as elaborate a bit more on the value you can offer them. Do so while highlighting how your skills and experience make you a perfect fit for a desired position. Don’t simply summarize your resume though, as this is redundant and offers nothing new or ‘enticing.’ Sending a well-crafted cover letter to an employer shows a lot of initiative, makes a great first impression, and can help you stand out in a competitive job market.

Andrew Chen, Chief Product Officer, CommentSold

 

Create a Personal Website Or Blog

If you’re a college senior looking for a job, one way to get ahead of the competition is to create a personal website or blog. That is something I did after college and it landed me a job at Airbus. With a personal website, you can showcase your skills, experience and knowledge to potential employers. You can also use your website to connect with other professionals in your field. And if you’re blogging, you can demonstrate your writing and research abilities. Creating a personal website or blog is a great way to stand out from the crowd and show employers that you’re serious about your career.

Ludovic Chung-Sao, Lead Engineer & Founder, Zen Soundproof

 

Start Reaching Out for Informational Interviews

Start reaching out for informational interviews. Utilize LinkedIn to connect with employees at companies that you’d like to work for and ask to buy them a coffee. When you meet, ask questions about the business and what skills are needed to succeed there. Afterward, keep an eye out for jobs at the company and reach out to the employee when you apply. They may have some pull or any tips to add to your resume.

Project Manager

One cannot overstate the value of a great project manager. A job in project management is a crash education in risk management, stress tolerance, and diplomacy, from detecting and removing bottlenecks to guaranteeing the flow of communication in cross-functional teams. New graduates seeking the freedom of working from any location should take note of these dynamic roles, which may frequently be performed remotely. It may be necessary for you to begin as an assistant before spending a few years working on your Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. The flexibility and career potential of these in-demand positions, however, may be astounding if you get past the initial obstacles. As an added benefit, you get to interact with a wide range of individuals, increasing your visibility and creating a top-notch professional network. Starting salaries for entry-level positions are $57,500, but with time and the PMP certification under your belt, you may be able to earn $90,000+.

A lot of college graduates are opting in for the social media management niche and it is no surprise. Social media management comes easy to a lot of graduates because most of them are familiar with the internet, and a lot of businesses are going online to market their business. In addition, the learning curve for social media management is low when compared to other careers. Besides, there are a lot of detailed courses on social media management that college graduates can take to become familiar with the niche.

Simon Bacher, Simya Solutions

 

Accountant

Accountant. This career path is popular among college graduates from various fields of study. A degree in accounting is not a must. Still, becoming a Certified Public Accountant makes you a good candidate for the job in question. The head for numbers and being detail-oriented are also very much welcome. Accountants’ responsibilities include keeping track of a company’s records, making critical financial decisions, conducting financial audits, and more. They earn approximately $77,250 a year.

There is an immediate need for recent college grads to boost the region’s technology sector’s talent pool.

Steve Pogson, FirstPier

 

User Experience Designer

More and more people are choosing to become UX/UI designers after college. UX designers don’t require coding experience but rather focus on advocating for the user and creating the experience of interacting with a software or technology. It is a very rewarding and lucrative career with massive potential for growth now and in the future.

Michael Burghoffer, PicoSolutions

 

Market Research Analyst

As a STEM student looking for a money-earning career, market research is the bull’s eye.

Some states enable college grads with any bachelor’s degree to teach provisionally while they get their license, making elementary and kindergarten teaching a popular choice for fresh grads.

Tyler Hull, Modern Exterior

 

Administrative Assistant

A popular job for college graduates to get their foot in the door could be an Administrative Assistant.  This allows college graduates to get some experience to list on their resumes and if they want to continue working for that same company, a great start to climing up the career ladder at that company.

Typically, Administrative Assistants are the face of the company as they are the first person that you interact with.  This allows for the Administrative Assistant to make connections with other employees at the company and to decide if the company would be a good fit for them to continue their career.

Lindsey Hight, Sporting Smiles

 

Travel Consultant

It’s safe to say that the newer generations value work-life balance and frequent travel a lot more, which is why many of them are slowly turning their attention to the travel and tourism industry. By interning at a travel agency, college graduates can pick up all the necessary skills needed to become a freelance travel consultant and understand where their interests lie. After this, they can follow it up with a diploma in their niche of preference and work remotely or anywhere in the world.

Guy Sharp, Andorra Guides

 

Sales

What types of jobs are popular for college graduates depends on the field of study. However, a common job for business students is a sales position. The pay is usually pretty good, and the required experience is minimal. It’s an attractive job for recent young graduates because it has performance pay and requires motivation.

Tech Industry Jobs

One of the most popular jobs for college graduates is in the tech industry. As technological innovation continues to grow and expand, more and more jobs are opening up without the need for experience. Skills like digital and content marketing can be taught or achieved with an online certification. This is opening up a ton of opportunities for graduates who may have a degree in another industry, but would like to apply their skills in tech.

Top 12 Summer Jobs for Teens in 2022 | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/top-12-summer-jobs-for-teens-in-2022/,"What is a good summer job for teens who are planning on attending college in the fall?


To help recent high-school graduates find good summer jobs, we asked recruiters and career coaches this question for their best recommendations. From restaurant jobs to running a produce stand to finding a job in your future industry, there are several summer jobs that may help college-bound teens earn some money, gain valuable exposure and acquire some transferable skills that will serve them well in the future.


Here are 12 summer jobs for college-bound teens in 2022:
Restaurant Jobs 
Valet
Social Media Editor
Landscaping
Retail Jobs
Summer Camp Counselor
Babysitting
Run a Produce Stand
Dog Walking
Recreation Center Jobs
Realty Office Assistant
A Job in Your Future Industry

 

 

Restaurant Jobs 

Working at a restaurant is a great summer job for a college-bound student. Summer is a busy time for dining, so tips stack up quickly. The personal interactions of a restaurant also provide important socialization skills for young adults. Because a restaurant often has a young and energetic staff, there is a great opportunity to make new friends and work in a fast-paced environment. On the other hand, learning to deal with difficult managers, coworkers, or customers will provide vital lessons in how to practice patience, humility, and handle conflict.

dan potter, CRAFTD

 

Valet

Rising college students should consider being a valet for the summer. Valets are usually a role associated with the service and hospitality industry. Being a valet does not mean that the student has to be interested in a service or hospitality career. However, it is a great role to gain some experience in the short term. Hospitality jobs often require knowledge of customer service which is valuable information in essentially every industry. Knowing interpersonal skills and how to interact with customers will be useful to students in their future careers. Valet is one of the roles in the hospitality industry that offers major opportunities for young people to make connections as they interact with important customers from a variety of industries. Rising college students should consider being a valet for their summer job.

Liza Kirsh, DYMAPAK

 

Social Media Editor

Teens should consider becoming social media editors for some small businesses in their community. For example, a popular local restaurant will benefit from a digital marketing strategy or a boutique downtown. The younger generations have extensive knowledge of successful digital platforms and what content works for each. They can use this opportunity as a first step into the professional world before they attend college in the fall.

Sara Adam Slywka, Nestig

 

Landscaping

One good job for a teenager who will be collegebound in the fall is a landscaper. Landscaping is very steady work and easy to be trained on. Additionally, landscapers work seasonally, and coming back on breaks from college can be an easy arrangement. Working outside all day and getting some fresh air is a perk in and of itself too.

Kevin Callahan, Flatline Van Co.

 

Retail Jobs

Work in retail to gain organization and financial skills. Stores have to be cleaned to the best of their ability and clothes folded neatly so it’s presentable. In addition to cleanliness, sales associates are responsible for handling money at the cash register, which can help them with logistics and finances when they’re on their own. These skills are the initial building blocks for college students to survive on their own.

Jodi Neuhauser, Ovaterra

 

Summer Camp Counselor

College-bound teenagers make great summer camp counselors. Mentoring even younger minds at camp is a great chance to foster and educate the next generation of citizens and leaders before a teenager ventures off to college. This perspective will help stabilize them as they transition into adulthood and look to their older peers for guidance. Staffing a summer camp is a wonderful way to practice leadership, celebrate youth, and make some money while you’re at it.

Thomas Yuan, Sanebox

 

Babysitting

A great summer job for teens planning on going to college is babysitting. While many think of it as a once-in-a-while type of job, an enterprising teen can make babysitting a full-time job before they go off to school. They would need to do some marketing on social media and flyers, and they would need to keep a calendar for babysitting appointments and obligations. However, a teen that takes on this job that way can earn thousands in summer from parents who work and need daytime child care, along with those who want an evening out.

Bruce Tasios, Tasios Orthodontics

 

Run a Produce Stand

Teens who want to go to college can test their entrepreneurial skills with a produce stand or pop-up shop. This involves getting produce, flowers, and other items from local farmers or craftsmen but these products sell well in the summer. These shops close up in the fall, so it would be a good fit. A small stand would give teens a chance to run a shop without a lot of extra expense. It could generate enough revenue to pay for college as well. Some teens have done it every summer for years, earning enough to pay entirely for their college tuition.

Michael Gorlovsky, Windermere Orthodontics

 

Dog Walking

A great summer job for teens who want to go to college is being a dog walker. It’s easy and a good option for teens who love animals and like being outside. It is also good for those who don’t yet have a car because they can focus on neighbors with dogs in their neighborhood. Those who can walk several dogs at a time can make good money. It will also give them a chance to do something that benefits their neighbors and get to know others in their neighborhood.

Fadi Swaida, Halton Village Dental

 

Recreation Center Jobs

Working at a rec center is a great low-stress summer job for teens planning to attend college in the fall. The money isn’t spectacular, but a rec center provides a good opportunity to save a bit of money for an upcoming higher education endeavor. Additionally, there are multiple positions to choose from at a recreation center, including a lifeguard, front desk receptionist, gym manager, or game room attendant.

Ray Leon, Pet Insurance Review

 

Realty Office Assistant

Realty offices can offer a good summer opportunity for students who plan on attending college in the fall. Realty offices are often in need of assistants who can help with daily operations. These positions tend not to require outside training, but they can provide a great experience in regards to an office environment and interpersonal skills. Rising college students may even be able to assist in showing listings to potential clients. Students can leave this role come fall and feel confident in knowing that they have developed a number of professional skills.

Katy Carrigan, Goody

 

A Job in Your Future Industry

Find a summer job in the industry that you will want to enter after your college life has ended. Seek a job that can give you hands-on knowledge and experience that will benefit you down the road. If you have aspirations of working in the social media industry, find any internship that offers you vital insights into the inner workings of those platforms. If law, medicine or finance is your calling, go to any law firm, hospital or investment group that is hiring seasonal workers or interns. Reach out to school counselors, professors, teachers, or anyone else who can help you get your foot in the door. Be on the prowl for jobs that teach you the nuts and bolts of the field you aspire to enter.

10 Best Practices for Interviewing as a Recent Graduate | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/best-practices-for-interviewing-as-a-recent-graduate/,"What is one best practice when heading into an interview as a recent college graduate? 

To help recent college graduates prepare for job interviews, we asked career coaches and HR leaders this question for their best advice. From being clear and intentional to demonstrating a willingness to work and learn, there are several best practices that may help you feel more prepared and confident going into an interview as a recent graduate.

Here are 10 best practices for interviewing as a recent graduate:
Be Clear and Intentional
Avoid Being Too Casual With The Interviewer
Do Your Research
Know How To Present Your Background and Experience
Play Up Your Soft Skills
Take Time to Understand the Job
Emphasize Skills and Lessons Learned in College
Prepare Alternative Answers for Work Experience Questions
Bring a Pen and Paper
Demonstrate a Willingness To Work and Learn

 

 

Be Clear and Intentional

Many college students will interview without a lot of clarity around what they want. This may come across as “I’m still trying to figure it out” or “I just want a job that gives me the ability to travel.” Instead, be intentional about what you are working towards. Have a clear narrative for why you’re applying for that role or company. You don’t have to make a lifelong decision, but interviewing with an intentional purpose will help you stand out from other recent graduates.

Logan Mallory, Motivosity

 

Avoid Being Too Casual With The Interviewer

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve interviewed a recent college graduate, established some good rapport, and been referred to as “bro” or “dude” in the interview. I’m not your “bro,” and don’t call me “dude” in an interview. I’m your interviewer and prospective employer. If a candidate wants a position at a company, maintain a level of professionalism while still being true to who you are.

Brett Farmiloe, Terkel

 

Do Your Research

Do some research and learn about trends in their industry, as well as who your interviewer is, the history of the company, and their mission. What goals, accomplishments, awards, and or distinctions have set them apart as leaders in their field? Understanding who is looking to hire you and knowing what they are all about can make a big difference in setting you apart from other candidates, during the interview. Discover what they are looking for in terms of particular qualities or experience, and then prepare yourself accordingly to become as attractive and qualified a candidate as possible!

Lastly, remember that the interview is not just about them getting to know you, but about YOU getting to know them! Do your goals align with theirs? Is this a place where you could see yourself growing and being happy? When you focus on the interview being as much for you as it is for them, it makes the experience much less nerve-wracking.

Linda Scorzo, Hiring Indicators

 

Know How To Present Your Background and Experience

You should be able to talk through your accomplishments and challenges from each role on your resume. This means having specific examples and a story to tell. When you have your stories already thought out, you’ll be ready for any of those common “tell me about a time when…” questions. You can also add those examples to any other type of question you’re asked. It’s okay if you can’t quickly recall every experience, that’s where your preparation comes in. Take some time in the days before the interview to recall (and even write out) your experiences ahead of time so they are easy to remember on the day of the interview.

Marisa Allen, University of Arizona, Eller College of Management

 

Play Up Your Soft Skills

As a recent college graduate, it’s likely you don’t have a ton of experience in your field. However, there are soft skills, like communication, leadership and adaptability that are valuable no matter what your job is. Once you identify your best soft skills, be prepared to show (and not just tell) how you use them. Is there a time when you made a real difference during an internship, as part of a college organization or in life in general? Offer real-life examples that play up those soft skills and what you’re capable of.

Jae Pak, Jae Pak MD Medical

 

Take Time to Understand the Job

As a new college graduate, entering into an interview can be scary because of all the unknowns. You have so many questions prior to the interview and afterward. The key is to prepare weeks in advance. Look up the company’s core values, write out the questions you want to ask at the end of the interview, and make note of your strengths and weaknesses. Lastly, understand the duties and responsibilities within the job description and make note of how your previous experience can contribute to the new role.

TK Morgan, Tuesday at 1030

 

Emphasize Skills and Lessons Learned in College

As a recent graduate, highlighting the skills gained and lessons learned in college can be very beneficial. Not only do you show the organization that you really applied yourself, but it also shows that you retained useful information. Highlighting your unique journey and skillset also sets you apart from the other candidates.

Hilary Kozak, LivSmooth

 

Prepare Alternative Answers for Work Experience Questions

There are often questions in an interview about past workplace experiences, asking you to describe past customer/coworker interactions or your response to common workplace scenarios. These can trip up recent college grads who don’t have much (or any) work experience to draw from. You can prepare for this by looking up the most common hypothetical or situational interview questions and brainstorming some similar scenarios you’ve experienced in an internship, school club, classroom, volunteer activity, etc.

You never want to respond with “I’ve never had that experience” when it comes to questions about soft skills like leadership, communication, and teamwork, or about your greatest strengths, weaknesses, accomplishments, or mistakes. Knowing in advance what you’ll answer to these common questions can help prevent your lack of workplace experience from being an impediment to getting hired.

Archie Payne, Caltek Staffing

 

Bring a Pen and Paper

Bring a pen and paper to take notes during an interview. This is a great way to retain the knowledge of all of the information the company shares, which may include day-to-day tasks, salary, or hierarchy within the company. To the manager, it shows you’re engaged and interested in the position. First impressions are everything, and this small tip will ensure your interaction is a positive one.

Sara Adam Slywka, Nestig

 

Demonstrate a Willingness To Work and Learn

The best practice when heading into an interview as a recent college graduate is to show you are willing to work and learn. We already know that it’s hard to find a first job that we love, but if you show them that you are willing to work and learn more, it’s easier.

Show them that you are organized, committed, and responsible and that you think it’s better to learn by doing, and trying. Go to the interview a little earlier, maybe 10 to 15 minutes, with a smile on your face. I was an HR leader for a long time at a small company. We hired some recent college graduates at the time, and the ones who stayed with us were the most energetic and committed.

I know it’s not easy, but, if you do this, they will be more inclined to hire you, and they will be happy to have someone with such a willingness to work.

14 Tips for Recent Graduates Entering the New Hybrid Workforce | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/14-tips-for-recent-graduates-entering-the-new-hybrid-workforce/,"What is one tip for recent graduates entering this increasingly popular hybrid workforce?


To help you enter the hybrid workforce, we asked HR leaders and small business owners this question for their best advice. From flaunting remote working skills on your resume to asking interviewers about work environments, there are several tips that may help you break into the new hybrid workforce as a recent graduate.

Here are fourteen tips for recent graduates entering the new hybrid workforce:



Flaunt Remote Working Skills on Your Resume 
Consider the Lifestyle You Want
Make Connections
Police Yourself to Stay Focused
Stay Up-To-Date on Digital Work Tools 
Be Prepared to Work Harder to Earn Your Boss’s Trust
Find a Mentor
Apply to Jobs Regardless of Location 
Consider In-Person Positions 
Be Prepared to Learn
Read all Training Materials and Ask Questions 
Polish Your Writing Skills
Look for Teams that Collaborate Across Departments
Ask Interviewers About Work Environments

 

Flaunt Remote Working Skills on Your Resume 

My tip for recent graduates entering the hybrid workforce is to mention your remote work skills on your resume as well. I know you try to brag about the expertise you have achieved, projects you have completed, and rewards you have earned. But, don’t forget to mention your hybrid or distributed work expertise. How you can manage a remote team or work in a remote work environment and how you can maintain your productivity in the hybrid ecosystem are a few attributes to mention on the resume. The hybrid work model is going to stay here for long and you need to prove to your employer that you are comfortable and suitable to sustain in this kind of ecosystem.

Caroline Lee, CocoSign

 

Consider the Lifestyle You Want

Consider what kind of lifestyle you want, and whether you want to work in an office or at home. You could also consider whether you want to work some days in an office and some days at home. As you are applying to jobs, make sure to find more details about the work models of these jobs. Then you will be able to assess which jobs will work better with the lifestyle that you want.

Matt Miller, Embroker

 

Make Connections

One of the most important tips for graduates, or anyone, entering into the hybrid workplace is to make and maintain quality relationships at work. It is so easy to stay isolated in your own bubble when working from home, but challenge yourself to interact or work with one new person on your team each week. This is a great way to immerse yourself in the company culture, build relationships for the future, and show to your team how valuable you are as a teammate.

Joe Spector, Dutch

 

Police Yourself to Stay Focused

With people working from home, being able to police yourself and stay focused will be more and more important. It can be easy to get distracted while working from home, so staying aware of how often you are getting distracted will help you be a better employee in the long run. Eliminate things that can cause you to lose focus and decrease your productivity from your workspace. Keep your workspace organized so you can easily find what you need to get your work done.

Brett Sohns, LifeGoal Investments

 

Stay Up-To-Date on Digital Work Tools 

Since the pandemic began, there has been a huge demand for remote work software solutions. Learn about innovative digital work tools that you can incorporate into your virtual workspace to increase productivity. You’ll really come off as an experienced employee when you share your expertise with your team and managers. TheVerge.com is one of my favorite websites for staying up-to-date on the latest tech trends.

Stephanie Venn-Watson, fatty15

 

Be Prepared to Work Harder to Earn Your Boss’s Trust

Employers today are more accustomed to managing on-site teams, and many of those in charge of hybrid workplaces are new to handling remote staff. In such a situation, I’ve observed some skepticism among managers of WFH employees about their reliability, with some going as far as comparing remote work with paid vacation. While seasoned workers may have established a good relationship with their direct reports and working off-site might not be as problematic for them, I think recent grads will have to work harder to get their bosses to trust them. 

I strongly recommend that new employees at hybrid workplaces stay available online during work hours, be prompt in answering questions, and make an extra effort to participate in group discussions and meetings to reassure their managers about their activity. Similarly, trusting your employer, manager, and supervisor is equally important to stay engaged and productive in the long term.

Anjela Mangrum, Mangrum Career Solutions

 

Find a Mentor

Recent graduates should look for a mentor that can guide them to success. Some new hires may feel out of place and unsettled in a remote/hybrid work environment. This is especially true for entry-level workers as this may be their first job out of college. An employee that can show them the ropes of the company’s mission, values, and method of working will not only help them get acclimated but make them feel like a part of the team. Daily Zoom calls, as well as weekly in-person meetings, will be extremely beneficial in the beginning stages, and can then transition to every other week or monthly get-togethers. Everyone should feel included in the workplace – and a mentor can lead the way.

Sara Adam Slywka, Nestig

 

Apply to Jobs Regardless of Location 

Don’t let location deter you from applying for opportunities. Businesses are increasingly satisfied with hiring a remote employee, if that applicant shows great potential. With hybrid models increasingly becoming normalized, location is no longer the deterrent it once was for hiring. So don’t be shy when applying for positions–as long as you feel qualified and the position looks appealing, you should send in an application.

John Jacob, Hoist

 

Consider In-Person Positions 

Recent graduates should not assume that remote work is best for them. Those in-person, spur-of-the-moment conversations that happen in an office setting are almost impossible to replicate on Slack channels or Zoom meetings. Some companies, like ours, insist on employees being present whenever possible. College graduates should embrace such an opportunity because there is no better experience than being around experienced individuals with different points of view. In an office setting, you’re more engaged and more motivated, and you don’t miss critical conversations that happen when the camera isn’t on. You’ll wind up being a more effective worker in the office.

Scott MacDonell, Bambee

 

Be Prepared to Learn

The job market is changing and with it, the way we work. With so many new opportunities in the hybrid workforce, it’s important to be prepared to learn new things on the job. This means being open to new technologies and ways of working and being ready to hit the ground running on day one. In a hybrid workforce, you need to be proactive in order to get ahead, take every opportunity that comes your way, and use it as a learning experience. Keep an open mind and be willing to work hard and you’ll be successful in this new type of workforce.

Peter Lucas, Relocate to Andorra

 

Read all Training Materials and Ask Questions 

The best advice for recent graduates entering the remote workforce is to read everything relating to a new job from start to finish and ask questions when appropriate. A new handbook, training manual, etc. is one’s most important tool with remote work. Taking in as much information as possible about the role and supplementing it with questions when a meeting does occur ensures the best understanding of the new position. Curiosity from a new employee will never be frowned upon.

Loic Claveau, Prometeus Labs

 

Polish Your Writing Skills

Working in a hybrid environment means that you will certainly communicate with a part of your team solely online. This is why improving your written communication skills is essential. From writing formal emails to managing to convey your point clearly and concisely, it all makes a difference in communication where nonverbal cues are removed.

Georgi Todorov, thrivemyway

 

Look for Teams that Collaborate Across Departments

“Could you give some examples of how my role impacts other roles or departments on the team?” This interview question will help a recent graduate discover if different departments are working well with one another despite all of the recent changes. With hybrid work, many departments are siloed from each other, which can cause confusion or tension. It’s best to try to enter a role knowing that product, design, sales, marketing, etc. are all working fluidly. The applicant can also ask how team wide decisions are made, and how major changes are announced. These questions will also show the interviewer that you are invested in the company overall.

Carla Andre-Brown, Mailbird

 

Ask Interviewers About Work Environments

While hybrid work models have become more common these days, this is not to say that every company has mastered the art of managing a hybrid work environment. When you are interviewing for a job with a hybrid work model, ask the interviewer questions such as “What is the work environment like?” and “How much are remote employees included?” so that you can get a sense of what it would be like working at this company, whether in person or remotely.

Prepare for Spring Internship Applications: 12 Steps to Take | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/prepare-for-spring-internship-applications-12-steps-to-take/,"What is one step to take when preparing to apply for Spring internships?

To help you prepare for Spring internship applications, we asked business owners and career coaches this question for their best advice. From starting the process early to sending handwritten thank you notes, there are several steps you can take to best prepare you for the Spring internship season. 


Here are 12 steps to prepare for Spring internship applications:



Start the Process Early
Generate an Internship List
Build Your Network
Social Media Audit
Research the Company
Refresh Crucial Skills
Ask Questions in Advance
Brush Up On Your Interviewing Skills
Have Every Unique Experience Ready to Share
Use Your School’s Career Services Department
Prepare for Rejection
Standout With a Handwritten Thank You Note

 

 

Start the Process Early

Start early. The sooner you start preparing, the better. Make a list of companies you’re interested in, research their interview processes, and start putting together your application materials. Most companies begin the hiring process in January and February for Spring internships, so the time to apply is as soon as possible.

Claire Westbrook, LSAT Prep Hero

 

Generate an Internship List

Prepare your list of internships early. Figure out what creative project or video interview you are going to need to do to stand out from the crowd early and get prepared now. Have a list of 5-10 internships and have a unique preparation for each one. It is a lot of work, but the reward is worth it.

Michael Jankie, Natural Patch

 

Build Your Network

One step to take when applying for spring internships is to build out your network. A great way to do that is through Linkedin, and if you don’t have an account there I highly recommend you make one. The best way to find the most relevant people for you to connect with is through the job search tool. You can add in what industry you’re most interested in and it will give you a list of places hiring that are most relevant. Once you have looked through and found some appealing opportunities, I would then go through the people that work at the company and filter by which university you attend or attended. Alumni from your school are almost always willing to talk to aspiring professionals in their field. You can then send a quick message asking if they’d have time for an informational interview where they’ll explain their position and you are able to ask questions. This is a great way to show interest while also building out your network.

Gregg Dean, Layla Sleep

 

Audit Your Social Media

One important step to take when preparing to apply for Spring internships is to do a social media sweep and tidy up your online presence. Even if you are conservative in your online posting, other users might tag you in material that might reflect poorly with recruiters. Best to update your privacy settings to make it so that you must review and accept any tagged content before it is associated with your account, and to do a search to ensure that there is no incriminating material on your current profile.

Michael Alexis, TeamBuilding

 

Research the Company

One of the best practices when preparing for an internship interview is to look through the company’s website and research them as much as possible. Look into the products/services provided, the company’s values, leadership, etc. This will show your commitment to landing the role during the interview process. Being prepared will also let you anticipate the kinds of questions you’ll be asked ahead of time.

Bill Lyons, Griffin Funding

 

Refresh Crucial Skills

Hard skills are crucial for prospective interns as their experience rarely differentiates them. Being able to stand out with software abilities can make a difference. Using time to fill the knowledge gaps and obtain certificates will strengthen your applicant position. It will also make your career more meaningful as you will likely get to work with programs you know sooner.

Michael Sena, SENACEA

 

Ask Questions in Advance

It helps to attend a networking event regularly. Those events are a great way to also find out about internships. Ask questions. This will help you determine which internship is best for you. It’s always a good idea to plan for an unpaid internship. Maybe you can save some money in advance as well.

Shaun Price, MitoQ

 

Brush Up On Your Interviewing Skills

I always advise students to brush up on their interviewing skills by taking part in mock interview sessions. This can usually be scheduled at your university’s career services center, in which you can practice interviewing and receive immediate feedback on areas to improve upon. Many students seem to forget that these services exist, and they can really give you a leg up in the competition when you’ve practiced with a few mock interviews.

Kristine Thorndyke, Test Prep Nerds

 

Have Every Unique Experience Ready to Share

When you’re applying for Spring internships, you’ll typically be up against a lot of competition. That’s why it’s not just important to include the unique aspects of your experiences, but to actually showcase them. What will set you apart from everyone? Whether it be your volunteer work or specialized courses you’ve excelled at, be sure to include everything that can prove you’re a good fit for the internship.

Lindsay McCormick, Bite

 

Use Your School’s Career Services Department

If you are in college, you can use your career services department to assist you with finding a Spring Internship. Depending upon your major they can probably connect you with relevant internships. While you can look for internships on your own, it does not hurt to seek help as well, just in case.

Drew Sherman, RPM

 

Prepare for Rejection

It’s important to prepare for rejection when applying for Spring internships. While applying to internships is a fun and exciting time, there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive the only internship you applied for. Consider sending in resumes for several opportunities, and use potential rejections as motivation. Don’t take personal offense to these rejections. Everyone will find their own path and it will always work out the way it’s supposed to.

Corey Ashton Walters, Here

 

Standout With a Handwritten Thank You Note

After your interview, send a handwritten thank you note to each person who interviewed you. In the note, express your gratitude for their time and reiterate your interest in the position.

Employers often receive dozens (if not hundreds) of applications for a single position, so standing out from the crowd can be tough. Sending a handwritten note is one way to show that you’re truly interested in the internship and went above and beyond to make an impression.

What Should I Wear to a Virtual MBA Interview? 9 Tips | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/what-should-i-wear-to-a-virtual-mba-interview/,"What is one tip you would give to someone who is wondering what to wear—and how to prepare—for a virtual MBA interview?

 

To help you prepare for a virtual MBA interview, we asked MBA candidates and hiring managers this question for their best tips. From researching the interview attire to going with a classic look, there are several ideas to help you choose what to wear and improve your confidence going into the MBA interview.


Here are nine tips for dressing for a virtual MBA interview:



Research Interview Attire by Scanning the Website
Dress Professionally but Don’t Wear a Tux
Business Casual is Always a Safe Choice
Prioritize Comfort and Fit
Ask for a Recommendation from the University
Don’t Let the Relaxed Remote World Influence Your Dress
Dress for Confidence (and Speak to Your Experience)
Connect With a Current MBA Student
Go With a Classic Look

 

 

Research Interview Attire by Scanning the Website

One tip for dressing and preparing for a virtual MBA interview is to snoop on the school’s website and social media handles for cues on wardrobe and demeanor. The way the school presents its students to the world provides a solid example of the kind of appearance you should aim for. Also, perusing these profiles can provide inspiration for talking topics, and you can use news and tidbits gleaned from these searches to ask thoughtful questions or make conversation during the interview.

Michael Alexis, TeamBuilding

 

Dress Professionally but Don’t Wear a Tux

Dress professionally; it doesn’t matter if your meeting is virtual or in-person. Remember, first impressions matter, and virtual interviews are no different. This doesn’t necessarily mean you need to put on your finest tux or try and go for a cocktail dress, you can go for something a bit more comfortable like a nice sweater on top of a shirt. You can also opt for a blazer and a shirt or just a shirt alone. Whatever you decide to wear, make sure it’s clean, ironed, and well put together. There’s nothing worse than a wrinkled shirt or a dirty piece of clothing.

Jessica Ulloa, MyPerfectResume

 

Business Casual is Always a Safe Choice

If you’re feeling unsure of what to wear for your interview outfit and it’s stressing you out, I always say business casual is a safe bet. You probably have a nice shirt and jacket to go with it, and by picking your favorite go-to’s, you will feel relaxed and confident.  I wouldn’t worry too much about your bottom half unless for some reason it will be in the camera’s range. If you make sure the top half is looking clean and put together, your appearance will be the least of your worries!

Tom Mumford, Undergrads

 

Prioritize Comfort and Fit

You need to think beyond just the clothes you’ll be wearing and also focus on how well they fit. Wearing an oversized blazer or a suit that’s too tight will be counterproductive in helping you make a good first impression. We often forget that a suit that was tailored to fit years back won’t necessarily complement us the same way so being mindful of comfort and making alterations is always a good start.

Harry Morton, Lower Street

 

Ask for a Recommendation from the University

Though often better to overdress for an interview, what’s the harm in asking for a recommendation? Reach out to the university and ask for clarity about what their expectations are. Contact their own career department or ask a current student what they would suggest. Don’t be afraid to ask – the answer will help you go into the interview with more confidence…and the right outfit!

Logan Mallory, Motivosity

 

Don’t Let the Relaxed Remote World Influence Your Dress

In the relaxed world of remote work, it is easy for a casual dress approach to trickle into an interview, however, what you wear can have a major impact on that first impression, so it is best to resist this temptation. You will not be expected to be overly formal, but a button-up shirt or blouse that gives off a professional vibe can go a long way in sending the message of your seriousness about the position and your adherence to a professional company culture.

In addition, pay attention to your background, as this too, can also send a distinct message. Just as you would not invite someone to your home when it is messy, that rule should apply to your virtual interview.  By approaching your virtual interview the same way you would if you were doing it in an office setting, you will prevent embarrassment and place yourself in a great position to make a good first impression.

Woody Sears, Hearhere

 

Dress for Confidence (and Speak to Your Experience)

I’d suggest wearing whatever you feel most confident in. Some men prefer a full suit, others a long-sleeve button-up without a tie. Your webcam is only going to catch you from above the waist, but wear the kind of pants/skirt/dress that you’d feel comfortable wearing in the office, alongside like-minded colleagues. Sweatpants are for relaxation, not interviews.

When it comes to the interview itself, tell your story. Have a one, five, and ten-minute version of your path toward where you currently are. You won’t deploy all three, but you’ll be better able to go in-depth or lean toward brevity as the question allows.

David Patterson-Cole, Moonchaser

 

Connect With a Current MBA Student

Imagine that the interview was in-person, so wear business professional attire, think: suit. Prepare by connecting with a current MBA student in the school you are interviewing with. Ask them what their experience has been like; what they have been most surprised about; how the classes have prepared them for their summer internship; and steps the school has been taking to help students network with companies for permanent placement. That will help you tremendously when you formulate your questions to ask the interviewer. When it comes to preparing for the questions you may be asked, google ‘STAR interview questions’, and then create flashcards with the questions on the front and the example you have chosen to talk about, on the back. Record yourself answering the questions so you can see where you are having difficulty.

Crystal King, Amazing Baby

 

Go With a Classic Look

There are classic colors that will never go out of style when it comes to interviews: Navy jacket, solid-colored shirt or blouse, red tie or scarf (stripes and checkers don’t translate well virtually). When you are dressed well, you will feel more confident.

Listen to all of the questions thoroughly and take a moment to give yourself room for a thoughtful answer. Know why you want to be accepted into the MBA program (“this will give me the opportunity to pursue my passion in the _________ field”) and let this “knowing” drive you to do well in your interview.

Writing a Grad School Interview Thank You Email | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/writing-grad-school-interview-email/,"So you’ve decided to embark on a new and exciting journey in your education by applying to a graduate school program. You join the ranks of many other scholars who seek to advance their education.

Low and behold, with an exceptional grad school application, you have moved forward in the process of completing an interview with the university. What comes next? You may think that all that is left is to wait and see if you are accepted into your chosen program. However, you may be missing the extra step of sending a grad school interview thank you email.

Why You Should Send a Thank You Email After Your Grad School Interview

Many prospective students do not follow up with the university they interview with either because they don’t believe it is necessary or because they don’t know to. With this extra step of sending a friendly thank you letter after your graduate school interview, you will be on the interviewer’s radar as an enthusiastic candidate. Also, the interviewer will see that you are genuinely interested in their graduate school and take the process seriously. Going that extra mile might mean the difference between acceptance and denial.

Best Time To Send Your Post-grad School Interview Thank You Email

The best time to email your grad school interview thank you is within 24–48 hours after completing your interview.

A grad school interviewer will often interview several candidates in anticipation for the upcoming semester. Email them any later and your email may be out of context from the interview haze. Or worse, the interviewer may get the impression that you are inconsiderate or forgetful.

The clock starts ticking as soon as you leave the interview, but don’t let this timeframe rush you to send a poorly written email. Take some time to evaluate your performance, and make notes on interesting talking points. The following list is a good starting point for compiling ideas.

What interested you about the degree program
Some of the strongest answers you had given
Any information the interviewer provided that stuck with you

This isn’t all of the information that you should put in your thank you email. Keep reading to learn about essential thank you email components.

Information to Include in Your Thank You Email

The point of your post-grad school interview email is to thank the interviewer.

A generic thank you email is inauthentic and won’t cut it, here. Grad school interviewers will often interview several candidates in a small period of time. You must insert unique identifiers that’ll make your interview memorable.

In addition to the notes that you took post-interview, consider adding the following notes to your grad school interview thank you email.

Elaborate on why you are thankful for the interview
Show appreciation for the interviewer’s time
Restate your interest in their grad school program
Give one fact about why you would make a good candidate

You’re well on your way to writing a thank you email. Review the samples below to guide your writing process.

Winning Grad School Interview Thank You Email Samples

Once you’ve compiled a few talking points, you’re ready to write your thank you email. Don’t be overwhelmed by the task! The email doesn’t have to be a thesis—a few short paragraphs will do. Below we have listed some examples that you can personalize instead of simply copy and pasting.

Sample Grad School Interview Thank You Email #1

Dear Dr. LaCroix,

I wanted to reach out and thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to interview me for the Creative Writing Program at Northwestern Arizona University. I appreciate that you were able to go over some of the aspects of the program which make it unique. The most appealing part of the Creative Writing Program that you shared with me is working with publishing houses based in NYC.

Your advice on having me submit more of my creative writing to larger publications helped motivate me to get my work to a wider audience. I enjoyed your feedback on my writing style, and I believe that I would be an ideal candidate for Northwestern Arizona University’s program due to my dedication to the art of storytelling.

I look forward to hearing from you once final decisions are made. Once again, thank you for the opportunity to interview with you.

Sincerely,

John Doe

The beginning of this letter starts with thanking the interviewer, then explains specifically what the student was thankful for. The student also touched on specific aspects of the interview so that the recipient would remember the student. The email ends with a call to action and restates the thank you.

Sample Grad School Interview Thank You Email #2

Dear Dr. Scheibel,

I wanted to thank you for generously considering me for the Masters of Biology program at MIT. I know that you have a busy schedule, and I appreciate your time interviewing me and sharing some of what makes MIT unique.

The interview with you shed some light on what I can expect in the program. I especially like how MIT has biology research labs on-site and opportunities for internships. I believe that my background in working in a biomedical research lab for the past two years has prepared me for the next step in my career, which is obtaining my graduate degree to study microbial diseases.

Again, thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you on your final decision.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe

Again, the sample grad school thank you email opens with a thank you. The opening also acknowledges that the interviewer has a busy schedule and is doing you a favor by taking the time to interview you. The email further mentions a specific program detail that the interviewee likes and why. The letter ends with why they would be a good candidate and thanking the interviewer. The call to action motivates the interviewer to maintain contact with the writer.

Sample Grad School Interview Thank You Email #3

Dear Dr. Roderick,

I hoped to reach out and thank you for talking with me about the opportunity to study mathematics at UCLA’s Mathematics Graduate Program. Your dedication to interviewing me with your busy schedule shows me how concerned UCLA is with considering candidates for their graduate programs.

Thank you for explaining how the library at UCLA has its own collection of mathematic resources that I could use while studying. Because of my experience in tutoring math at the undergraduate level, I think that I would be able to accomplish my dream of teaching mathematics at a university.

I am happy to have learned more about the program and hope to hear from you when final decisions are made.

Sincerely,

John Doe

The opening paragraph is focused on thanking the interviewer and why the writer is thankful. The second paragraph details a few of the interviewer’s talking points to show that the writer was paying attention during the interview. The author then writes a background sentence on why they should be admitted to the graduate program. The last paragraph summarizes the grad school interview thank you in just one sentence.

Connect with the Best Resources for Grad School Interviews

Whether you are at the point of sending out that professional thank you letter after your grad school interview or still going through the process of interviewing, InterviewFocus has the tools you need to make the best impression possible.

Future graduate students already know the definition of hard work and dedication. This also translates to how much effort and preparation you put into an upcoming grad school interview. With InterviewFocus, you can take advantage of their mock interviews, which give you personalized feedback on your eye contact, filler words and even facial expressions.

Why Your College Interview Attire Matters

Before discussing how to dress for a college interview, let’s discuss three reasons why your clothing matters.

Like your body language and facial expressions, the way you dress is a form of non-verbal communication. By dressing well, you’ll show the interviewer that you take the opportunity seriously, respect their time and really want a spot in the incoming class.

Since visual elements play a large role in first impressions, you can be sure the interviewer is taking note of your attire. This is especially true during a virtual college interview since the distance makes other elements of connection impossible—you can’t shake hands, for example.

Dressing well is not just for the interviewer’s benefit. A professional and clean look helps you put your best foot forward. The way we dress affects how we feel and act, according to social psychology research. Studies have found that formal attire can help the wearer feel more confident and think in a more long-term mindset.

You’re going up against other candidates in this competitive process, and an unkempt appearance will set you apart for all the wrong reasons. So take the time to select the perfect ensemble using the tips below.

Virtual College Interview: What to Wear

Here’s an important virtual college interview tip: dress the same way you would if the interview took place in person.

Here’s what to wear to a college interview:

Clean, conservative and well-pressed clothing
A modest collared shirt
Dress pants or slacks with a belt
Knee-length or longer skirts and dresses
Neutral colors
Closed-toed shoes

Determining how to dress for a college interview begins with knowing the dress code.

Before the interview, do some research to determine the dress code. You can talk to current students, read the university’s online guide or speak with your college counselor for an idea.

Men

Confused about what to wear for your college interview? Explore the range of styling options below to find one that will leave you looking polished and clean.

Wear a long-sleeve button-down shirt tucked into neatly pressed khaki pants. Details like a simple wristwatch and belt help make you look more put together. Close-toed dress shoes or loafers complete the look. Even though the shoes likely won’t be seen, it’s important to dress well from head to toe.

Another option is to wear a tie over your long sleeve shirt. Pair it with dress slacks or khakis as well.

Styling tip: Choose a tie with a solid pattern since busy prints can come across as distorted and distracting on a video call.

A button-down shirt with no tie and a jacket is another alternative. Rather than wearing a suit jacket, opt for a sports jacket. This is a less structured garment that offers a comfortable yet polished look. Or opt for a blazer which is a bit more structured but still less formal than a suit jacket.

For a business professional look:

If your interview requires business professional clothing, a full suit and tie are in order. Typically, neutral colors—navy, black, and grey—are preferred. Make sure the suit fits well, especially in the upper area. You don’t want to look like you’re squeezed into a tight suit or drowning in an oversize jacket.

Women

Deciding what to wear to a college interview can be difficult with so many options. Pants, skirts, and dresses are all on the table. Read on to find an option that suits your style and makes you feel comfortable.

A crisp, solid-colored oxford shirt is a timeless choice. Try multiple shirts to find one that allows for movement and can be buttoned up for a modest look. Pair the look with dress pants and a pair of flats for a comfortable and sleek look.

Styling tip: If you opt for a white or light-colored shirt, ensure that the fabric is opaque, not sheer.

You can also opt for a high neck blouse or turtleneck. Layer a cardigan over your button-down shirt or blouse to add another texture or color to the look. For bottoms, a knee-length pencil skirt makes a great impression.

Alternatively, you can opt for a dress. Avoid busy prints that may look odd or pull attention away from you during a video call. Instead, opt for a structured dress with sleeves (short or long) and a neckline that does not plunge. You can pair the dress with a cardigan as well.

For a business professional look:

Elevate your college interview attire with a pants suit or skirt suit. This includes a neutral-colored blazer on top and a matching knee-length skirt or pair of dress pants. The top and bottom don’t necessarily have to be the same color, but they should complement each other well. While your shoes will likely remain off-camera, a pair of sensible heels is a great option for this ensemble.

Common College Scholarship Interview Questions to Expect | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/common-college-scholarship-interview-questions/,"Earning a scholarship eases the financial burden of attending college and unlocks networking opportunities down the road. If your route to securing a scholarship includes an interview, you’ll need to practice before the big day.

Due to the rising cost of attending college, an increasing number of students are searching for scholarships, making the competition for these awards stiff. This means that preparing for your college scholarship interview is crucial.

The list of college scholarship interview questions below will help you prepare to show the panel that you are a student worth investing in.

Common Scholarship Questions

No matter what scholarship you are applying for, the interviewer wants to know who you are, how you think and what drives you. These following college scholarship interview questions are ones that you should be prepared to answer.

1. What is your proudest accomplishment?

Many students feel the need to be modest about what they’ve achieved. While you don’t want to come across as cocky, it’s okay to talk about your accomplishments and discuss why you are proud of them. The interviewer wants to know about your work ethic and how you view success. Be sure to discuss why this achievement means a lot to you and how you could reach it.

2. Tell me about a person who you look up to. Why do they inspire you?

Who you look up to says a lot about what you value in life. Showcase who inspires you and provides clear examples of actions this person has taken that you appreciate. This type of question is a great opportunity to tell a story that sticks in the interviewer’s mind. If you select someone well-known, be sure that the person is not in conflict with the college’s values or organization you’re interviewing with.

3. Imagine yourself five years from now. What are you doing?

This question might cause your heart rate to increase. Take a deep breath. Interviewers understand that students are still figuring out plans. The point of this question is to determine whether you have a forward-looking mindset. Are you the type of person who floats along in life or formulates goals and takes action?

4. Why do you deserve this scholarship?

There’s a very high probability you’ll be asked this question. So why not formulate a great answer ahead of time? In your answer:

Include a reason that’s different from what others will likely say. For example, “I am a hard worker” might be accurate, but it’s unoriginal.
Explain how you connect to or embody the values of the award. Pick one specific trait that you possess and demonstrate how it aligns with the mission of the college.
Discuss a challenge or hardship that you have overcome and how that has prepared you for upcoming challenges.

These are just a few of the ways you can approach this question. Feel free to tailor your answer to showcase your unique points of differentiation.

Academic Scholarship Questions

Academic scholarships are one type of merit-based scholarship that many colleges and organizations offer. Since these scholarships typically have high GPA requirements and other requisites to determine who makes it to the interview, expect questions about more than just your academic achievements.

1. What extracurricular activities or community service involvement have you participated in?

Much like, “Tell me about yourself,” this question is almost guaranteed to come up in your interview. The interviewer is looking for a well-rounded applicant who will be active in and out of the classroom. Discuss a meaningful activity you take part in outside of academics. Then share what drew you to it and how it adds fullness to your life and impacts others.

2. Discuss a time when you made a mistake.

Life is full of challenges. Sometimes, you make mistakes. This question analyzes how you deal with personal shortcomings. Are you self aware, or do you deny responsibility? To impress the interviewer, discuss when you messed up and share how you solved the problem or made amends. Then, talk about what you learned from it.

Make sure you choose a mistake that is not too personal. For instance, mentioning your failure to ask for help when taking on a large project is more appropriate than talking about a mistake you made in a romantic relationship.

3. What is your greatest strength? What is your greatest weakness?

This is another question that allows the interviewer to gauge your level of self-awareness. You should discuss a strength that you can demonstrate via a story or past activity. For instance, stating that your strength is perseverance and then discussing how you rose above many challenges and maintained a high GPA is powerful.

When it comes to weaknesses, don’t pretend to be perfect. Select a real weakness, then discuss how you’re addressing this weakness. For more tips on discussing strengths and weaknesses, read our guide to answering common college interview questions.

4. How would earning this scholarship impact your college experience?

Discuss why you are a deserving candidate for this scholarship. Would this award allow you to pursue leadership positions on campus rather than taking on a job to pay for school? Is there a unique reason that you deserve this scholarship? Share an honest and compelling answer with the interviewer.

Community Involvement Scholarship Questions

Community service scholarships award students that have made an impact on their communities. Whether the award is being offered by a local organization or a nationally recognized one, be prepared to answer these college scholarship interview questions.

1. What has been the most rewarding part of your community service experience?

You’ve made a difference in your community—what do you get out of it? This is not the time to talk about how community service looks good on a resume. Instead, discuss how the service widened your perspective, made you more grateful for your circumstances or allowed you to connect with others in a way you otherwise would not have.

2. How do you plan to continue community service during your time as an undergraduate?

Your time at college will likely be busy. Discuss how you will ensure you continue to give back. Before the interview, research community service opportunities on campus and in the local area. Having concrete examples of what you plan to do is leagues above a vague response about making time for volunteering.

3. What led you to choose your major, and what do you hope to do with it?

As important as your community involvement is, college is about education. This question provides you with an opportunity to show you’re serious about academics. Share how much you value a college education and how this scholarship would help to make it possible. Then, discuss your future career plans. If possible, tie your professional goals to the community involvement cause that you’re most passionate about.

4. How do you align with the values of this organization?

This question might come in a different form, such as:

What do [insert values] mean to you?
How does your service align with the history of this college or organization?

The point is to assess whether you’re the right fit for the award. Discuss how you live out the values of the college through your service. If the scholarship is in honor of a particular individual, share how that individual lived by the values and how you strive to as well.

Athletic Scholarship Questions

In addition to competing for a position on the team, you’ll compete against talented athletes for scholarships from the school. Present yourself as a polished and well-rounded candidate with thoughtful answers to these questions.

1. How are you different from other athletes hoping to join the team?

This does not have to be an athletic-related answer. The coaches have your stats and tapes. Share something unique and even surprising about yourself. If you play an instrument, mentor young kids, volunteer at a local charity or do anything that makes you appear well rounded, include it in your response. If you do have an athletic-related answer, make sure it is memorable.

2. What interests you about this athletics program?

It’s no secret that athletes look around at several different schools before settling on one. Let the interviewer know that you are seriously considering this school and share a few concrete reasons why. To build rapport, you can share a story from your time interacting with current athletes and coaches. Describe how the attitude or actions of the people signaled to you that this program is special.

3. Tell me about your academic performance.

One constant struggle for coaches is dealing with grade eligibility requirements. Each university has minimum GPA requirements that athletes must meet to play. This question allows the scholarship committee to gauge how serious you are about school.

If your grades are lackluster, be honest about those shortcomings. Reassure the interviewer that you are committed to your education and do whatever is necessary to keep your grades up. Whether you have excellent grades or ones that leave room for improvement, stress your dedication to performing well in the classroom.

4. Is there anything you would like to share with the committee?

This is a frequently asked college scholarship interview question that leaves the floor open to you. Capitalize on this moment by expressing something you were not able to say during the interview.

This can be something you appreciate about the college or a further explanation about how the scholarship will help you. Before the interview, think of a few things you could say for this answer. Of course, make sure you follow up the next day with a thank you note.

12 Common Sorority Interview Questions for Pledges | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/sorority-interview-questions-to-expect/,"Rush week is an exciting experience! You’ll connect with members from different organizations, and hopefully, find the perfect sorority for you.

But, for many potential new members (PNMs), the process can be nerve-wracking. Whether you have your heart set on a particular sorority or are keeping an open mind, knowing how to respond to sorority interview questions is a must.

Ahead, we’re breaking down twelve common sorority interview questions and providing you with tips on answering each one.

12 Sorority Interview Questions to Expect

Unlike a college admissions interview, a sorority interview is a more relaxed conversation. Of course, you want to put your best foot forward. But it’s important to come across as authentic and approachable.

Remember, the sister you’re talking to is gauging how well you would fit in with the other women in her sorority. Being authentic opens the door for connection, making you more memorable when bid day rolls around.

Here are seven sorority interview questions that you can expect during rush week.

Opening Day Questions

Round one of the recruitment is fast-paced and light-hearted. You’ll meet with members from various houses on campus and answer questions about your background and goals.

Why did you choose this college/university?

Out of all the colleges to attend, you selected this specific campus. Share what drew you to the college. Avoid mentioning parties, drinking and other related activities in this question and throughout all of recruitment. Share something meaningful about the university. You can talk about a program the school offers that you’re interested in, the fact that you have family members that attended or how the location drew you to the school.

What’s your major?

This is one of the most common sorority interview questions, and you’ll be answering it throughout the day. When you share your major, add a reason why you selected it. Is there a passion or unique aspect that drove you to pick it? Is there a long-term goal that the major will help you reach? Share something unique and deeper than a one-word answer.

Where are you from?

This question is pretty straightforward, but it provides an opportunity to connect with the sister you’re talking to. Rather than simply stating the place you’re from, share what you like about it or how it’s different from the college town. You can also ask the interviewer where she is from to keep the conversation going.

Why are you interested in Greek life?

Refrain from giving a generic answer about making connections that last a lifetime. While that might be your goal, you want to stand out. Research the values of the sororities you’re most interested in for discussion ideas. Also, think about something unique about your life and weave it into your answer.

For example, “Throughout high school, I was a member of the soccer team. I made amazing friends, and we always knew we could count on each other. Now that that chapter of my life has ended, I think that a sorority would be an amazing place to cultivate new friendships and join a group of amazing women as we navigate college together.”

Did you do anything fun over the summer?

A sorority is a sisterhood. Each house is looking for fun and dynamic members. Highlight an exciting or adventurous activity you participated in over the summer. If you worked hard at an internship, share a bit about that experience. If you took a fun vacation, tell an interesting story from your travels.

Do you have any plans for involvement on campus?

Well-rounded women make great additions to a sorority. Share an interest you have and a club or organization that you’re thinking about joining. Since leadership positions are available at sororities, this is a great opportunity to ask the interviewer about sorority leadership.

Round 2 & Round 3 Questions

Congratulations! You made it through the whirlwind of opening day conversations. Now, the sorority interview questions will turn towards sisterhood and philanthropy-related topics.

What were you involved in during high school?

If you are a freshman rushing a sorority, expect a few questions about your high school experience. This sorority interview question allows you to choose what aspect of that experience to focus on. For example, you can discuss athletic involvement and highlight your ability to form friendships and contribute to a team. At a sorority that prizes high GPAs, you can discuss academic involvement. If you were part of an honors program or debate club, feel free to discuss that experience.

If possible, connect this answer to the present to keep the conversation flowing. For instance, “I loved doing that in high school. I’m looking forward to participating in something similar on campus (intramural sports team, leadership club, etc.).”

On the other hand, you could say, “Now that I’ve finished that and learned a lot, I’m interested in branching out and trying [insert new activity].”

These finishers allow the sister to share insight about what the campus offers and, if applicable, her own experiences with these activities.

Do you have any volunteer experience?

Philanthropy is a significant part of Greek life. If you have volunteer experience, talk about your involvement and experience. If you didn’t volunteer in high school, don’t worry. Discuss organizations that you’d be interested in volunteering for or share your interest in participating in the sorority’s philanthropy activity.

What do you hope to get out of joining a sorority?

Be open about what led you to rush and why you’re interested in being a part of a sorority. There are so many routes you can take with this question. Share how you see the sorority helping you grow as a person and allowing you to give back in a meaningful way (philanthropy). Or discuss the friendships you hope to build, the leadership opportunities, and more.

What values are most important to you?

Sororities want to know who you are and what you stand for. Think about what drives you and what values you appreciate in other people. For example, loyalty and leadership are two important values for many sororities.

Find values you resonate with and discuss how you view them, and live your life according to these values. You can also talk about why they are important and who has modeled these values in your life.

Are there any hobbies or interests that are part of your life?

The girls you’ll be speaking to want to have exciting and memorable conversations. Since they’ll be chatting with several PNMs throughout the day, standing out is crucial. One great way to be memorable is to share a passion. Discussing a true passion makes you come across as interesting and authentic. Whether it’s a common activity or a unique one, share how it has impacted your life and why you enjoy it. Ensure you are honest about these interests and activities; a sister will likely dig deeper and ask more questions about them.

What do you enjoy doing with friends?

This sorority interview question allows a sister to understand what you’re like in day to day life. Would you mesh well with the girls in a specific house? It’s important to give an honest answer, not an answer you think someone wants to hear. After all, you want to get a bid from a house that likes you for you. As always, refrain from discussing partying in your answer.

Pref Day Questions You Can Ask

The last part of recruitment is known as pref day. This is the most serious part of the recruitment, and it tends to be emotional. It’s important to open up to sorority members at this point in the process. Here are a few questions you can ask:

Why did you decide to rush this sorority?
How has this sorority affected your college experience?
What is your favorite memory with your sorority sisters?

Because pref night allows you to have more time with the remaining sororities you’re considering, you’ll be able to have more in-depth conversations and get your questions answered. So be sure to prepare some questions ahead of time.

Be a Memorable PNM Who Wows at Recruitment

We hope you found these sorority interview questions and answers helpful. To make it through multiple rounds of recruitment, get some rounds of interview practice under your belt. Whether your recruitment is happening over Zoom or will occur in person, InterviewFocus is here to help.

What to Bring to a Virtual College Interview | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/what-to-bring-to-virtual-college-interview/,"Whether you’re a prospective out-of-state student or your schedule is too busy to make the trip to campus, a virtual college interview is a convenient option to make an impact and fulfill your interview requirements.

This college interview checklist shares the items you need to have ready when you join the virtual meeting and some things you should avoid. For a smooth virtual conversation, read on!

Things To Bring to a Virtual College Interview

To bring or not to bring? If you’re unsure of what items you need to bring, take a look at the list below.

A Notepad and Pen

Taking notes during the interview is a great way to show the interviewer you’re engaged. Plus, it allows you to keep track of important information and jot down questions that come up. Typing notes on your computer might make you look unfocused. Furthermore, the sound of the keyboard could be distracting—opt for a pen and paper instead.

ACT/SAT Scores

While it’s not guaranteed, your interviewer may ask about your standardized test scores. Having these scores readily available is a good idea, so you’re not scrambling to recall your scores. You can memorize your score or write them down on a sticky note near your computer. Alternatively, you can print out a copy of your complete college application, so you have access to your essays and scores nearby.

Resume

During an in-person interview, a student could leave a copy of their resume at the end of the interview. In a virtual format, this is not possible. However, having your resume handy might be useful. It won’t hurt to have it pulled up on your computer screen or printed nearby.

Post-interview Questions

At the end of the conversation, you have one more chance to wow the interviewer. When they ask if you have any questions, have a few ready to go. Ask questions that stand out and whose answers can’t be found with a quick search on the university’s website.

Major-specific Items

Certain items may be of use if you’re applying for a specific program. Art students should have a portfolio of work handy. Athletes may need to have a video reel that’s ready to play. Drama or dance students may bring performance clips to share at the interview. These items can help foster conversation and allow the interviewer to see a side of you that’s difficult to express with words.

Requested Items

Go through past emails and other communications with the admissions office. Is there anything that they recommend bringing to your interview? Sometimes, an interview will request a student to bring their transcripts, test scores or other documents. Show the interviewer that you listened by having these items with you at the time of the interview.

An Updated Account

Whether you’re using Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or another platform, ensure you have the latest version on your computer. Schedule a test call with a friend or family member to address loading problems or glitches before the interview. Also, verify that your username is professional.

Backup Plan

Even the most well-planned interviews can experience technical difficulties. Rather than panicking, have an action plan already prepared. If the video call fails, can you take the interview onto a phone format? Make sure you have an alternate communication method with the interviewer if the video platform malfunctions or the internet goes down.

What You Shouldn’t Bring to a Virtual College Interview

Now that we’ve covered what to bring to a college interview, it’s time to discuss what to avoid. These virtual interview don’ts will save you from making unprofessional mistakes.

Canned Responses

While it is wise to practice before your interview, you don’t want to sound robotic. Cliche answers that sound scripted will not help you stand out in a college interview. Have an idea of your responses, but leave room to change or add to these answers as necessary. That way, you come across as authentic and genuine.

Distracting background

You should be the focal point of the interview, not your background. Opt for a simple background free from clutter, distracting decor and bystanders.If you live with others, inform them of the day and time that you are interviewing.

Unprofessional Attire

Since the interviewer will only be seeing the top half of you, it’s tempting to reach for comfortable bottoms before the interview. But wearing a full interview-ready outfit can help you get into the interview mindset and positively impact the way you carry yourself, including your posture. Plus, if you have to stand up during the interview, you don’t want the interviewer to see sweatpants.

Ace Your College Interview with InterviewFocus

A virtual interview brings its own unique challenges. But with the right preparation, you can make a good impression, no matter where you’re logging on from.

To practice like a pro, use the interview preparation software, unlike any other. InterviewFocus utilizes proprietary technology to analyze your interview performance and help you improve.

"Personalize ""Tell Me About Yourself"" in a College Interview | InterviewFocus",https://interviewfocus.com/personalize-tell-me-about-yourself-in-college-interview/,"No matter how many lists of college interview questions you pore over, you can’t predict everything an interviewer will ask. Nevertheless, some questions you can be sure will come your way.

Odds are “tell me about yourself” or some variation of it will be amongst the first opening interview remarks. Prepare for this cold open and impress the interviewer with this college interview guide.

Why College Interviewers Ask This Question

Before you set out to answer “tell me about yourself” in a college interview, get into the interviewer’s mind. Understanding why an interviewer asks this question allows you to focus on the question’s intent and shape a coherent response.

Interviewers ask this question because it aligns with the college interview’s overarching goal—getting to know you. An interviewer wants to understand who you are and how you would contribute to the student body. By allowing you to have the floor, an interviewer can uncover something they may not have otherwise learned about you.

The “tell me about yourself” question offers a smooth transition from small talk into the focal of the interview. Rather than launching straight into challenging questions, an interviewer wants to lay the groundwork. Starting on a conversational, open-ended question can set you at ease and allow for a naturally flowing interview.

Lastly, an interviewer may use details in your answer to guide the next portion of the interview. Remember, a good college interview feels like a productive conversation. Something you share in your answer could make for a great segue into the next topic or give the interviewer an idea of something to bring up later.

The opening questions of the interview set the tone for the whole conversation. Read on to learn how to put your best foot forward.

How to Answer “Tell Me About Yourself”

Now that you know what the interviewer is thinking, it’s time to formulate the answer to “tell me about yourself” in a college interview. Let’s get started!

What to Include

The “tell me about yourself” question can be a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, you can present yourself to the interviewer in a flattering way. On the other, there is the potential to get sidetracked and share information that is not relevant.

To give a complete answer that stays on track, you can include:

Details from your life that demonstrate how you’d be a great fit at the college
A brief look at what led you to apply to the college or choose your major
Your unique passions or interests (connect them to the college if possible)
Strengths and accomplishments that you can illustrate with stories
Unique details that capture your personality and help you stand out

If this sounds like a lot, don’t worry. We’ll walk through examples below so you can respond to “tell me about yourself” in a college interview in the way that works best for you.

How to Structure Your Answer

Giving your answer some much-needed structure will reduce the risk of rambling or omitting important information. While there’s no set structure that you must follow, consider the past, present and future strategy.

Past. Share a life event, moment, or journey that made you the student, leader or person you are today. This is a great place to share how an element of your upbringing has prepared you for future challenges. Keep this section brief and demonstrate how it relates to who you are today.

Example: I grew up in a military family that moved around in the states and internationally. Each time we moved to a new city, we learned about the city’s history and connected with locals to learn about the culture. I’ve learned how to appreciate and connect with people of other cultures. This led me to choose political science, emphasizing international relations, as my area of study. I believe that my background will offer a unique perspective as I pursue this path.

Present. Next, discuss who you are and what you are involved in. Share recent accomplishments and how they relate to the university. If some relevant activities and interests are not mentioned in your application, bring them up. You can also talk about what short-term goals you’re focused on at the moment.

Example: I’m currently in the second trimester of my Junior year at [school]. As the oldest of five children, I usually spend part of my day playing chauffeur for my younger siblings. On the weekends, I enjoy volunteering at the local animal shelter. I heard that [insert university] has a great club that spends time at the animal shelter near campus. I’d love to be a part of that. For my final year in high school, I’m focusing on finishing my last season of track and field on a strong note.

Future. This is your chance to showcase your potential. What are the hopes and dreams that keep you moving forward? Discuss what you can bring to the university and how you plan to be an involved member of the student body.

Example: As I look to the future, I know that I want to develop sustainable solutions for consumer-facing corporations. The business school at [insert university] places a large focus on sustainability. That is one aspect that drew me to the university and excites me about being a student body member.

Now you have a better grasp on how to answer “tell me about yourself” in a college interview. Below, we’ll leave you with a final tip for your preparation.

How to Prepare for a College Interview

When you wrote your college essays, you didn’t submit your first draft. You revised the draft until you were left with a college essay that you were proud to submit. When it comes to answering, “tell me about yourself” in a college interview, practicing multiple times is the best way to refine your answer.

It’s important to give these practice answers in a mock interview. InterviewFocus is a mock interview software platform that offers innovative solutions to interview preparation.

How to Write a College Interview Thank You Email [+Samples] | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/writing-college-interview-thank-you-email/,"Your college admissions interview is over. You walk out of the room and breathe a sigh of relief. The preparation and interview may be done, but there’s one more thing you can do to end the interview process on a great note.

Writing a college interview thank you email is a simple task that reflects well on you and can impact the interviewer. Ahead, we’ll break down how to write a college interview thank you note and provide sample templates.

When to Write a College Interview Thank You Email

Compose your thank you email while the interview conversation is still fresh in your mind. Ideally, you should write the note on the same day that your interview takes place. Additionally, interview etiquette proposes that you send a thank you letter within 24 hours of the interview; however, not immediately after.

Leave time after the interview to reflect on the interview and write a thoughtful note. If you took notes during the interview, reference them while you write. Otherwise, you can rely on memory since the interview took place very recently.

Now that you understand when to write and send a college interview thank you letter, it’s time to discuss the note’s contents. While your message should be unique to the conversation you had, it’s important to follow general guidelines.

As the name suggests, a thank you note should express your gratitude to the interviewer. Your expression of thankfulness should be clear and genuine. Rather than just saying “thank you,” include what you are thankful for. Thanking the interviewer taking the time to speak with you is a great place to start. If they offered any tips or suggestions that you found useful, you could mention these as well.

Another important component of a college interview thank you email is personalization. Add specific details from the conversation you had with the interviewer. You can do this by:

Mentioning an activity or interest that you and the interviewer both had in common
Discussing a program that the interviewer suggested you look into
Referencing an answer the interviewer gave when you asked a question

The sample thank you letters below offer concrete examples on how to weave details like these into a meaningful note.

In addition to conveying your gratitude, your college interview thank you note should express your interest in the school. In the letter, discuss a few key aspects of the school that excite you and make you eager to attend. Convey your enthusiasm about potentially attending the institution.

Also, keep in mind that the interviewer likely has a busy schedule. A college interview thank you note is not meant to be an essay or a recap of the entire interview. The thank you note should be concise and to the point.

 

 

Sample Thank You Letters for After a College Interview

Composing the thank you letter is easier after reading a couple of examples. Remember that your note should be unique to your conversation. A cookie-cutter thank you note won’t come across as thoughtful, so take time to personalize your note before you hit send.

Sample College Interview Thank You Note #1

Dear [interviewer],

I want to thank you for taking the time to meet with me yesterday. I thoroughly enjoyed speaking with an alumnus about the impressive and diverse school that is [university]. I remain enthusiastic about attending [university] and becoming involved in the student body. Speaking of involvement, I looked into the [student program] you mentioned and am impressed by the positive impact the group has made on sustainability at the school. It’s a testament to just how driven and innovative the university’s students can be. Thank you for sharing that with me and for the opportunity to interview. Please let me know if there is any additional information that I can offer.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

[your name]

The sample thank you note above begins and ends with gratitude. It referenced a specific detail from the interview and emphasized the candidate’s interest in attending the university. For a different approach with similar core components, read the sample letter below.

Sample College Interview Thank You Note #2

Dear [interviewer],

It was a pleasure meeting with you this morning. Thank you for sitting down with me and taking the time to get to know me. Hearing about your experience as a [university] student brought a unique perspective that excited me even more about the prospect of attending. It’s nice to know how welcoming the student body is.

I also enjoyed learning more about the opportunities that the [department] offers for students like me that are interested in double majoring. It’s clear that I would have the opportunity to pursue both my passions at [university]. Overall, speaking with you was a beneficial experience, and I want to thank you again for your time and consideration.

P.S I stopped by the [on campus cafe] you recommended and tried one of the blueberry muffins. You were right—they are delicious. Thanks for the tip!

Sincerely,

[your name]

This sample note takes a slightly less formal approach than the first and references multiple conversation pieces from the interview. There are multiple expressions of gratitude in the letter, and an upbeat tone helps convey enthusiasm.

How to Prepare for a College Interview | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/how-to-prepare-for-a-college-interview/,"From the avid conversationalist to the reserved introvert, everyone needs to prepare for a college interview. Building up your interview skills will help serve you now and in the future. In this guide, we’ll cover what to do before, during and after your college interview, so you are prepared and composed from start to finish.

Read on and find out how to prepare for a college interview.

Before the College Interview

You only have one opportunity to ‘wow’ the admissions department in your college interview. But if you start preparing in advance, you’ll have plenty of time to hone your interview skills. Focus, commitment, and the tips below will help you prepare for the interview ahead.

Get ready to answer common college interview questions

A college interview will mainly consist of—yup, you guessed it—interview questions. Since you know lots of questions are coming your way, take time to compile a list of ones you’ll probably be asked. Questions to expect include:

Why do you want to attend this university?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Can you tell me about a time when you overcame a difficult challenge in your life?

If you’re a busy student, we’ve got you covered. Browse our list of top 10 common college interview questions for solid interview preparation.

Research the school and develop your own questions

Another pivotal component of preparing for a college interview is performing research. Let’s be clear—we don’t mean doing a quick online search and scanning a few website pages. To stand out, dig deeper than the average applicant.

This means learning about the founding principles and core values of the institution along with current events. If you can, reach out to alumni or current students to get insights about the school and the interview process. This insider knowledge will give you a leg up in the interview.

As you learn more about the courses, campus, organizations and opportunities, compile a list of questions. This way, you’ll have a mental list of questions to bring up when the interviewer gives you the floor.

Sharpen your skills with mock interviews

You can only get so far by formulating answers and planning out how you’ll respond. The next step is to begin practicing. Set up a trial run with a counselor, parent or mentor who will serve as the interviewer and ask you questions. Once you’ve gone through a few rounds, take your mock interview to the next level with a mock interview service.

Unlike a run-of-the-mill mock interview, an InterviewFocus interview provides you with a detailed evaluation of six soft skills and personalized improvement recommendations. The proprietary software reports your eye contact, use of filler words like “uh” and “um” and examines facial expressions. By knowing your weak spots, you’ll be able to improve in the areas where it counts.

The Day of the College Interview

When the day of the interview rolls around, don’t let your nerves get the best of you. Below, find out how to prepare for a college interview on the big day.

Put your best foot forward

Research shows that how you dress impacts your confidence and even the way that you think. Dressing well also makes a great impression on an interviewer, so arriving in a professional outfit is a no-brainer.

Make sure your clothing is neat and wrinkle-free on the day of your college interview. The same presentation rules apply if you will be on a virtual video call.

Read our interview attire tips for more ideas on how to look your best.

Be punctual and on your best behavior

Showing up on time for your college interview is good, but showing up 10 to 15 minutes early is better. On the day of your college interview, give yourself plenty of time to account for heavy traffic or unforeseen circumstances.

To avoid a stressful situation, do the following a few days before the interview:

Confirm the address and room number (changes in interview location may have occurred)
Drive to the interview location and record the travel time

Once you arrive, be respectful and kind to each person you come in contact with on the way to the interview. You never know who you may come across, so it’s important to be polite.

Be mindful of body language

Your nonverbal communication speaks volumes! You can make simple adjustments to your body language to come across as self-assured and engaged.

Pull your shoulders back and sit up straight while you’re in the interview. Remember to smile at times as you speak and listen to the interview. Believe it or not, a smile is a powerful interview tool, so be sure to flash a grin when appropriate. Avoid hunching over, crossing your arms or fidgeting in your chair.

Implement the feedback from your practice interviews to correct your body language. Even small tweaks in posture can help you convey poise and confidence.

After the College Interview

Knowing how to prepare for a college interview is crucial. But you can also make an impact after you walk out the door. For a tip on making yourself a more memorable applicant, keep reading.

Leave a lasting impression

Sending a handwritten ‘thank you’ letter soon after your interview is a great way to let the interviewer know you’re thankful for the opportunity. Many applicants won’t send a note following an interview, and some may send an email to express their gratitude. But how many will take the time to write and mail a note?

In the digital age, a handwritten note is rare and impactful. It reminds the interviewer of your conversation and, once again, displays your interest in the school. Consider taking the time to pen a simple ‘thank you’ note.

Get Interview Preparation with the Pros

At InterviewFocus, we understand that college interviews can be nerve-wracking. We also understand that proper preparation can make all the difference when it comes to how you perform in an interview.

That’s why our innovative interview software analyzes facial expressions, reports the use of filler words, measures tone of voice and much more. Start practicing with mock interviews today by trying out InterviewFocus!

10 Common College Interview Questions to Expect | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/common-college-interview-questions/,"You answered the essay questions, filled out the application and jumped over other hurdles on the path to college acceptance. Now, you’ve made it to the interview stage. Congratulations! The next step is to prepare for the questions ahead.

In light of stiff competition, every element of the admissions process counts. Whether your interview will be in-person or conducted in a virtual format, you only have one chance to make a positive first impression.

Below, learn about 10 common college interview questions and what the interviewer is trying to determine by asking them. Plus, we walk you through how to respond so that you can answer with confidence.

Top 10 Common College Interview Questions to Expect
1. Tell me about yourself.

This is an open-ended question, but the reply should be focused and unique. View this question as an opportunity to connect your background, upbringing, experiences and other details to the university. Remember, this does not have to be a complete picture of you from start to finish. Instead, it’s a specific look at an angle of you the admissions officer has not yet seen.

How to respond: Rather than rambling on about your life story, stick to specific attributes that highlight your value as a student and productive member of the community.

For instance, you can talk about how an aspect of your upbringing shaped you into the individual you are today (an individual aligned with the university). You can share a challenge that has impacted you and how working through it has prepared you to excel.

Include the university in some part of the response. One way you can do this is by connecting yourself and your attributes to the attributes of the university that appeal to you.

2. Why do you want to attend [insert university]?

Also among common college interview questions is this straightforward inquiry. This question aims to find out how serious you are about the university. It reveals whether you have researched the school and cared enough to learn about it.

How to respond: Think about a few reasons why you really want to attend the university. Proactively brainstorm and select answers that don’t apply to every other school. Avoid talking about the prestige or exclusivity of the university, as it can come across as superficial. Instead, discuss a core value or unique aspect of the university that speaks to you.

If you visited the campus and had a positive experience that made you decide to apply, you can speak about the experience. If you are attracted to a certain program or university offering, center your response around the program. Give an authentic answer as to why you are applying.

3. What are your strengths and weaknesses?

These may be posed separately or as one question, but you’ll likely be asked about your noteworthy attributes and areas that need improvement. The interviewer wants to know what makes you a quality candidate and what differentiates you from others; asking about strengths is one way to accomplish this. At the same time, no one is perfect. A student who can self-evaluate and be honest about weaknesses is more believable and likable than one who cannot.

How to respond: When it comes to sharing your strengths, don’t feel the need to be overly modest. Showcase a specific attribute that you possess and that the university would admire in a student. If the situation allows, use a personal anecdote to communicate the strength you are sharing. Saying “I am resilient” is not as powerful as telling a story that puts your resiliency on full display.

When it’s time to discuss a weakness, choose one that is honest yet not damaging to your chances of admissions. For example, the tendency to spread yourself too thin is a better weakness to share than a tendency to shirk responsibilities. Once you select a weakness, frame it as something you are working towards improving.

4. What hobbies or activities do you enjoy in your spare time?

The interviewer has a lot of information about your academic performance and your extracurricular activities. However, they may not have information outside your academic career. To get a complete picture of you, the interviewer may ask about your free time. This helps to determine what type of person you might be outside of the classroom.

How to respond: Think about what you gravitate toward on your days off. What adds meaning to your life outside of school and community service commitments? You can discuss a skill that you are cultivating or a passion that you have. Whether it’s fishing at the lake with your family, learning a new language, painting, attending plays at your local theatre or another activity that conveys an interest that you have. Ideally, your passion should come across as you answer this question.

5. Tell me about a time when you overcame a difficult challenge in your life.

Interviewers understand that the way a person deals with obstacles says a lot about them. Since college will also pose challenges, interviewers are looking for students who can overcome and persevere. This question helps them to discover what you do in the face of adversity.

How to respond: The key here is to emphasize how you met this challenge rather than the details of the challenge itself. Spend the first part of your answer giving a brief description of the challenge such as when it occurred and its impact on you in one or more areas of your life (emotionally, academically, socially, etc.). Avoid going overly detailed by sticking to relevant information in this part.

For the majority of the answer, discuss how you approached the challenge and moved past it. Highlight specific qualities in yourself that this struggle helped you develop. You can also discuss an individual that helped you through it. Overall, share a focused message about what you learned from the challenge and how you carry that lesson moving forward.

6. What book has had an impact on your life?

Colleges are looking for the best and the brightest students to make up the next class. This question allows the interviewer to find out if reading is part of your life. It also allows the interviewer to understand how you analyze literature and think critically about its implications.

How to respond: Be honest and authentic—don’t ad-lib a book that you think makes you look good. Honesty is important because you will have to discuss the book, its implication and impact at length. If you mention a book you haven’t read or don’t remember well, you may come across as insincere.

Originality is important because having an answer that stands out makes you memorable. If you list a book that you think the interviewer wants to hear instead of the one you enjoy, your answer will fade into a sea of similar responses. If you choose a common work, make sure that you explain its impact on you from an interesting angle.

7. What is one accomplishment that you are proud of?

Some common college interview questions give you a chance to brag about yourself. That is the case with this question. Here, the interviewer wants to know what you’ve achieved and how you did it.

How to respond: If you have a specific achievement but are worried about not having enough to say about it, frame the accomplishment using the STAR method.

STAR stands for situation, task, action and result. You begin by giving context to the situation you were in. Then, discuss what your role was. Next, talk about how you achieved the goal. Lastly, share the positive results.

8. Who is someone that you greatly admire and look up to?

Asking about a role model helps the interviewer uncover what attributes you value in others and gives a glimpse into the type of person you would like to be. The interviewer is looking for a genuine response, including details about why this person is someone you look up to.

How to respond: Details. Details. Details. Don’t just state who the person is and their relationship to you. In your answer, illustrate how this person has been a role model in your life and what characteristics you hope to emulate. If you have a mentor or a counselor that has played a large role in your development, talk about specific situations they’ve helped with. Additionally, share a trait that is evident and why it is admirable to you.

You can also discuss someone that you don’t personally know but have read about. Share exactly what it is about this person that inspires you and how learning about them changed your mindset, goals, perspective, or other areas of your life.

9. What can you bring to [insert university]?

This question gets to the heart of the interview—what makes you worthy of a spot in the incoming class? Many common college interview questions hint at this, but this question lays it on the table. The interviewer wants to know what makes you special.

How to respond: Take a breath and gather your thoughts before answering this question. If you have prepared well ahead of time, your nerves won’t get the best of you. Now, share a combination of attributes that make you unique. Rather than speaking about one strength or talent, combine them to create a picture of a well-rounded student that adds value to the student body. Are you:

A first-generation college student?
A musician?
Someone who speaks multiple languages?
A child of a military family?
A dedicated community servant?
Someone who has lived in multiple countries?
An athlete?

Brainstorm a list of traits that describe you. Then, select a few traits and discuss how each one gives you a unique perspective and aligns with the university.

10. Do you have any questions for me?

The interviewer asks this question to allow you to learn more information about the school. It also helps them determine how serious you are about getting in. If you come prepared with questions, it sends a signal to the interviewer that you have a genuine interest in attending.

How to respond: Browse our list of memorable questions to ask a college interviewer to learn what to ask and what questions to avoid. In short, you should ask questions that convey your desire to be an involved member of the student body and bring up topics that you are genuinely interested in. Avoid questions that are easy to answer with a quick online search since this can make you look like you have not researched the university.

7 Questions to Ask a College Interviewer | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/stand-out-questions-to-ask-a-college-interviewer/,"The rise of test-optional college applications is leading universities to reexamine how different elements of the admissions process are weighed. After all, test scores and GPA are small factors of many that determine a student’s potential and capabilities.

It is in the interview that the admissions advisor gets to know what makes you unique. And asking memorable questions is one way to leave a lasting impression. As the significance of college interviews increases, preparation is a necessity.

While you can’t anticipate every question your college interviewer will ask, it’s safe to assume that they will open the floor up to you. To help you prepare, we’ve compiled a list of unique and thought-provoking questions to ask a college interviewer.

7 Questions to Ask During a College Interview
1. What surprised you about this university when you attended?

Good college interview questions display your interest in the school and the interviewer—this question does both.

Many interviewers are alumni and have fond memories of their alma mater. If yours is, ask a few questions about the experiences they had at the college. You can view the college from a different angle by hearing the answer to this question.

Getting an interviewer to open up to you about personal experiences is also a great way to foster real conversation and build rapport.

2. The [insert topic] initiative that the university launched is inspiring. Is there a way for students to get involved?

Next on our list of questions to ask in a college interview is one that shows off your knowledge of current campus events.

By noting a recent development, you convey that keeping up with campus news is important to you. Universities look for students who care about what is going on at the school, mentioning initiatives makes it clear that you did your research. Asking about how you can get involved also communicates your drive to be a positive force on campus.

If asking about involvement doesn’t apply in the situation, that is okay. Instead, you can ask:

What are the university’s long term goals in regards to this initiative?
Were students involved in getting this initiative pushed forward?
3. How would you describe the student body on campus?

When considering what college interview questions to ask, think about school culture, what matters to you about the people you’ll be surrounded by during your collegiate career? While interacting with students is the best way to ascertain this, the college interviewer can also provide insights.

Inquiring about the student body reveals your desire to get to know those around you. This question also uncovers what the atmosphere on campus is like. Will you mesh with the other students? What defines this student body and sets them apart from others? You can preface this question by mentioning your desire to meet new people at the university.

4. You mentioned the [insert name] program on campus. Are freshmen able to join?

You can come up with questions to ask your college interviewer while you are in the interview. While preparing questions beforehand is a smart approach, you’re not limited to them once the interview starts.

As you listen to your interviewer, take mental notes of topics or details that pique your interest. Then, let the interviewer know that they had your attention by inquiring about specific topics mentioned during the interview. This will display your interest in the topic mentioned and let the interviewer know that you listened attentively.

5. I noticed that the [insert name] department offers two tracks for [insert major]. Can you provide some information about the differences between them?

Specific questions about academic opportunities make good questions to ask in a college interview. If you are debating between two programs or two tracks in a certain program, now is a great time to ask about them.

This question exhibits your interest in specific educational paths and makes it clear that you looked into the programs. It also communicates your eagerness to learn more. Just be sure to ask for specific details so that the interviewer can give you detailed information that is not already on the school website.

6. How can a freshman passionate about [sustainability, mental health,etc.] positively impact the student body?

An inquiry displaying your interests is next on the list of questions to ask during a college interview. If you want to stand out, speaking about a particular passion is a great option. Allow the interviewer to see your selfless side and remember you as a hopeful student with goals outside of the classroom.

Your desire to make a difference on campus is another positive element that this question enhances. If your interviewer attended the school, they might give specific recommendations about where you can get started.

7. What is one annual tradition that students enjoy being a part of?

This lighthearted question allows you to learn something new about the school and makes the point that you want to be an active participant in campus events. Colleges want students who will do more than simply attend classes. Coming across as eager to learn and invested in school traditions is another way to make yourself memorable.

You can modify this question to ask for a more personalized view of school traditions from your interviewer. For instance, you can ask, “what was your favorite tradition on campus during your undergrad career?”

The Wrong Questions to Ask During a College Interview

In a college interview, there are certainly no wrong questions; however, there are questions that you should avoid.

What does this mean?

Steer clear of questions that can be easily answered by information on the university website. While good-natured, these questions show a lack of preparation. Start by researching the university. This action will not only help you answer questions during the interview but also inspire your list of college interview questions.

Instead: Ask for specific details that aren’t readily available on the university website. For example, if only a program description is available, ask for more information about the courses, professors and internship opportunities.

Don’t mention your chances of getting into the school. Simply put, at the time of the interview, the decision to extend an offer may not be finalized.

Instead: Ask about current students in the school. What are their qualifications? What can you do to prepare yourself to start at the school? Show your eagerness to be a crucial and beneficial addition to the student body.

Don’t ask questions or engage conversations that degrade other universities—even rival schools. It’s a compelling method to build rapport, bonding over “the competition.” However, these conversations, at best, will have college interviewers raising an eyebrow, and, at worst, hinder your chances at admission.

Instead: Stick with questions that relate to the university, programs and traditions.

Don’t ask college interview questions that don’t further inform your college-making decisions. No matter what, it’s crucial to be authentic in your inquiries. Many students search for questions to ask during a college interview that they believe will impress the admissions officer. This completely misses the point of this portion of the interview.

Instead: Use this as a time to discover if this university is right for you. Good questions to ask in a college interview are those that you care about.

Lastly, it’s helpful to think of the interview as a conversation—both you and the interviewer are trying to get to know each other. Specifically, the interviewer is getting to know you, and you are getting to know the school. Both parties want to know if this is a good fit.

Ask questions throughout the interview if it feels natural. For instance, if the interviewer asks about your involvement in the debate team in high school, you can end your answer with a question about debate opportunities at the university.

How Can Students Address Academic Achievements In a Job Interview? | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/how-can-students-address-academic-achievements-in-a-job-interview/,"How Can Students Address Academic Achievements In a Job Interview?

Navigating job interviews as a college student can be daunting, especially when it comes to articulating academic achievements. We’ve gathered insights from Founders, CEOs, and other professionals to provide you with a comprehensive guide. From leveraging challenges to showcase achievements to keeping academic discussions concise and relevant, explore twelve expert strategies on how to effectively discuss your grades and coursework in a job interview.

Leverage Challenges to Showcase Achievements
Link Coursework to Job Requirements
Emphasize Value from Academic Experiences
Translate Academics into Business Achievements
Highlight Collaborative Coursework Experiences
Provide Specific Academic Project Examples
Demonstrate Skills Beyond Grades
Structure Academic Achievements Effectively
Align Academics with Job Relevance
Incorporate Academics into Your Pitch
Draw Parallels Between Coursework and Job
Keep Academic Discussions Concise and Relevant

 

Leverage Challenges to Showcase Achievements

Discussing academic achievements can dovetail seamlessly into responses to frequently asked questions such as “tell me about a challenge you have overcome”.

These kinds of questions would be a golden opportunity to discuss how students have “managed time effectively to meet a deadline” and “demonstrated excellent attention to detail and self-reflection by proofreading and refining a lackluster first draft into a first-class essay”.

Grades themselves are also excellent quantitative proof of ability, so don’t be afraid to refer to them when asked about achievements and successes. You’ve worked incredibly hard to achieve them, so show them off!

Ross Crabb, Founder, Academic Performance Coaching

 

Link Coursework to Job Requirements

College students can effectively discuss their academic achievements in job interviews by linking their coursework and grades directly to the job requirements. For instance, they might highlight maintaining a high GPA to demonstrate discipline and dedication. Discussing specific projects, like leading the development of a mobile app using JavaScript, can show practical skills relevant to the job.

It’s also beneficial to mention how such projects enhanced technical abilities and soft skills, such as leadership and project management. Expressing enthusiasm for their field and a readiness to apply and grow their skills professionally can further impress potential employers, showcasing how academic experiences have prepared them for real-world challenges.

Here’s an example of how a student might discuss their academic achievements in an interview:

“During my university years, I maintained a 3.8 GPA, which reflects my dedication and discipline in my studies. For my senior project, I led a team that developed a mobile app using JavaScript, which directly relates to the responsibilities of this position. This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also improved my leadership and project management abilities, as I coordinated between team members and managed deadlines. I’m eager to apply these skills professionally and continue to grow within this industry.”

This approach highlights the student’s achievements and demonstrates their applicability to real-world scenarios, showing the potential employer how their academic background makes them a suitable candidate for the position.

Heather O’Neill, Career Expert and Certified Professional Résumé Writer (CPRW), Resume Now

 

Emphasize Value from Academic Experiences

Don’t make it about the “grades, coursework, etc.” when you are talking about yourself during a review talk from the perspective of the value you offer. 

So, if you did a senior project or an internship where you helped a company reach a goal or improve certain stats, then talk about that. Grades by themselves will only get you so far, but everyone is looking for someone who can provide them with value.

Frankie Schell, CEO, Support You Marketing

 

Translate Academics into Business Achievements

If you want to stand out in interviewers’ minds, you have to speak their language. That means translating your academic achievements into business-relevant, project-focused accomplishments. 

Instead of sharing your GPA and some obscure elective award, provide an example of how you worked with a team to complete a complex assignment on a tight deadline. Naturally, you’ll get bonus points if the subject is relevant to your desired role, but in this instance, process trumps content. Focus your story on “the how”—the role you played and the method you used to help (or lead) the team from start to successful conclusion.

You can also take this opportunity to share an example of something that didn’t succeed. Perhaps you worked on a similar project in your freshman year, and the team tanked. In this case, your story should focus on what you learned and how you changed your approach in future endeavors. 

Tim Toterhi, CHRO, Plotline Leadership

 

Highlight Collaborative Coursework Experiences

Some students have little or no work experience to mention in a job interview. In such cases, they should highlight their coursework and academic achievements. During the interview, they should focus on courses where they worked cross-functionally, collaborating with different peers and stakeholders. 

They can also emphasize their grades and discuss how they overcame challenges in difficult classes through strategic actions. These actions demonstrate soft skills that are valuable in the workplace.

TK Morgan, Founder and Visionary, Tuesday At 1030

 

Provide Specific Academic Project Examples

One way to do this is by sharing specific examples that highlight your skills and abilities. Instead of just saying, “I got straight A’s,” you could talk about a challenging project or class where you excelled. 

Maybe mention how you tackled a tough situation or how you worked well in a group project. It’s all about showing off what you learned and how it makes you a great fit for the job. And remember, it’s not just about the grades themselves, but what you learned along the way!

Catherine Mattice, Founder and CEO, Civility Partners

 

Demonstrate Skills Beyond Grades

I wouldn’t simply list my grades and coursework in a job interview. Instead, I’d focus on how my academic achievements demonstrate skills relevant to the position. For example, if I excelled in a challenging literature course, I’d highlight the critical-thinking and analytical skills I developed rather than just mentioning the A that I received. 

Similarly, if I took the initiative in a group project, I’d emphasize my leadership and collaboration abilities, linking them back to the specific requirements of the job. By framing my academic accomplishments as transferable skills, I can show potential employers how my educational background makes me a valuable asset to their team.

Dylan Callens, Teacher and Blogger, The Teachers’ Blog

 

Structure Academic Achievements Effectively

When discussing academic achievements in a job interview, college students should focus on how their grades and coursework are relevant to the job they are applying for. Here is a structured way to present this information:

Contextualize the Achievement: Briefly mention your academic achievements, such as high grades, honors, or specific courses relevant to the job. For example, “I maintained a 3.8 GPA and excelled in courses such as Advanced Data Analysis and Machine Learning.”

Highlight Relevant Skills and Knowledge: Explain how the knowledge and skills gained from your coursework apply to the job. For instance, “Through my coursework in Advanced Data Analysis, I developed strong analytical skills and learned various statistical software programs, which I understand are crucial for this role.”

Provide Examples: Offer specific examples of projects or assignments that demonstrate your capabilities. “For example, in my Machine Learning course, I completed a project where I developed a predictive model that improved the accuracy of forecasts by 20%. This experience taught me how to handle large datasets and apply complex algorithms.”

Connect to the Job: Relate your academic achievements to the job’s requirements or the company’s needs. “I believe these skills will allow me to contribute effectively to your team, especially in developing data-driven solutions for your clients.”

By following this structure, you can effectively showcase your academic achievements and make a compelling case for how they prepare you for the job you’re seeking.

Rayn Bonus, Talent Acquisition Manager, Offshore MVP

 

Align Academics with Job Relevance

Aligning academic achievements, such as grades and coursework, with the job would be the best way for students to highlight them. Suppose the interviewer specifically doesn’t ask anything about your academics. In that case, there’s still a common question where you can throw in such information: “Tell me something about yourself.”

Don’t want to overwhelm the interviewer with academic achievements unrelated to the job position. Prioritize only the ones that have some relation to the position. If you don’t have an academic achievement related to the job, you can still mention it. For this, you have to follow up with some learning or experience that can be helpful for that job.

For example, if you majored in history and are applying for a marketing associate position, you can say something like, “My senior thesis required me to analyze vast amounts of data and draw insightful conclusions. I believe these skills would be valuable in understanding market trends and customer data.”

Kalyani Vasa, Software Engineer, ConsaInsights

 

Incorporate Academics into Your Pitch

In a job interview, I would work your relevant coursework and grades into either your elevator pitch or in the description of a project that you’ve completed. Another place it may be easy to talk about it is when discussing challenges or problems you’ve solved. 

Oftentimes, there are problems in both team and individual projects, but you could talk about how you overcame those challenges to get honors or another relevant achievement. Whatever you do, make it feel natural as part of your experience, and less like you are listing achievements.

Lela Bones, Data Engineer

 

Draw Parallels Between Coursework and Job

One effective approach for college students to discuss their academic achievements in a job interview is by highlighting how the responsibilities and outcomes of their coursework align with the requirements of the desired job. 

By drawing parallels between the skills and knowledge gained in specific courses and the competencies needed for the job, students can demonstrate their readiness and capability. For instance, discussing how successfully completing a challenging project in a relevant course reflects problem-solving skills applicable to the job role. 

Using coursework success as a surrogate measure of job success can showcase practical application and initiative. This approach not only underscores academic achievements but also illustrates the candidate’s ability to transfer theoretical knowledge into real-world scenarios, enhancing their candidacy for the position.

Elisha Peterson MD MEd FAAP FASA, Anesthesiologist and Pain Medicine Physician, Elisha Peterson MD PLLC

 

Keep Academic Discussions Concise and Relevant

Focus on the relevant aspects. When discussing academic achievements in a job interview, keep it concise and highlight the key points. 

Briefly mention your GPA if it’s noteworthy, but also emphasize any relevant coursework or projects that directly relate to the position you’re applying for. 

Keep it professional and to the point, showing how your academic experiences have prepared you for the role you’re pursuing.

Transitioning from college to the professional world can be a challenging journey, so we’ve gathered valuable insights from Founders, CEOs, and other industry professionals. From remaining resilient and knowing your worth to building relationships with experienced mentors, explore the sixteen strategies these experts recommend for smoothly adapting to the professional landscape.

Remain Resilient and Know Your Worth

The professional world and workforce can seem scary when you’re fresh out of college, looking for a job, or entering your first role. Two things I would tell my younger self would be to remain resilient and know your worth.

Resilience comes in handy when you’re applying for jobs and going for interviews. You’re bound to face rejections, but don’t let that discourage you. Keep at it, and don’t look back on missed opportunities. It’s what happens next that counts.

Knowing your worth is important when you’re actually in your role. This is not purely based on salaries and compensation, but rather on how you’re being treated at this company. Do you feel valued? Do you feel heard? Is your hard work recognized? Do your values align? If the answer is no to most of these questions, maybe it’s time to look for a new opportunity.

Don’t be afraid to leave jobs that don’t serve you. If you’re just entering the professional world straight out of college, don’t be afraid to jump in. The water is great. Good luck!

Shalini Ramanayake, Marketing Manager, Pulse Recruitment

 

Find an Accountability Partner

One piece of advice I’d give to transitioning students is to get an accountability partner to help keep you focused. Life outside college involves a lot of hustle—finding and applying to jobs, completing paperwork, figuring out finances. 

The problem is, when things don’t move quickly, or you get overwhelmed and confused, you lose motivation to keep going. So, you need an accountability partner who understands the goal and helps you push through the challenges until you get on your feet.

Manasvini Krishna, Founder, Boss as a Service

 

Gain Experience Through Internships

Getting vocational experience through an internship for just a few months helped me bridge the gap between education and the corporate world. It was invaluable for me in landing my first full-time job out of college. 

I undertook three months of unpaid work not long after graduating. The practical skills I learned helped improve my resume, while hands-on experience of working in a corporate environment made the transition to my full-time job a lot easier.

James Waite, Founder, Remoteopia

 

Embrace the Professional Learning Curve

Entering the professional world can be exciting, but navigating the transition can feel overwhelming. The key is to embrace the learning curve, ask questions, and showcase professionalism.

Don’t be afraid to learn from colleagues and seek guidance. Embrace the challenge. Building relationships with colleagues creates a valuable support system, all while keeping in mind that everyone starts somewhere. Focus on learning and growing, and success will follow.

Perry Zheng, Founder and CEO, Pallas

 

Initiate Conversations with Industry Pros

Moving from college to the professional world is a very difficult process, and one that can be unsuccessful for many people. Don’t be disheartened by this, though—there are many strategies and approaches that can work. 

Personally, I went for a slightly off-center approach, which worked for me. I wanted to become a graphic designer, so my initial approach was to research the best and most appealing agencies in my area. I also put together a portfolio of my work. But the usual approach would be to simply go down the ‘here’s my portfolio, do you have a job?’ route. 

I didn’t actually do that—my first port of call was to start a conversation with someone from each of the agencies and do two things: compliment a specific piece of their work and ask for some advice—ideally in person. Just five minutes of their time at their studio to get some advice opens things up in a different way. 

You get face-to-face with someone in the industry; they immediately get an idea about your personality and character—which wouldn’t come across via email. This helped me massively. I got a multitude of meetings with industry professionals who were happy to spend a few minutes with me, give some feedback, and get to know me a bit. One of the agencies clicked with me on a personal level, and I was offered a job as a junior. The rest is history. 

The lesson learned is—think about an approach from a different angle. Be bespoke—research what they do. Make it about them.

James Sanderson, Creative Director, EverydaySomething

 

Network to Ease Career Transition

In college, I made a point to network with as many people as possible. When I graduated, this gave me a large network to call upon to help me start my career, and it worked. I started as an analyst in the same company as a friend, which really eased the transition. 

And I would recommend that new graduates do the same. Try to find a career that starts alongside someone familiar. It’s much easier than joining a company that is completely unfamiliar.

Bill Mann, Privacy Expert, Cyber Insider

 

Leverage Academic Networks for Entrepreneurship

Transitioning from a grad student to an entrepreneur involved a significant mindset shift, from academic learning to real-world application and from structured guidance to self-direction. One specific strategy that helped me successfully adapt was leveraging my academic network. I actively sought advice and mentorship from professors who had industry experience or entrepreneurial backgrounds. 

Their insights into the business world were invaluable, providing practical advice that complimented my academic knowledge. Additionally, I engaged in networking events and workshops within the university and the broader entrepreneurial community, which helped me build relationships that later supported my business endeavors.

Another crucial strategy was embracing continuous learning, but in a more self-directed manner. I dedicated time to learn about areas beyond my academic expertise, such as marketing, finance, and sales, which are critical to running a successful business. Online courses, webinars, and industry literature were instrumental in this self-education process.

This combination of leveraging academic networks for mentorship and embracing a self-directed learning approach in practical business areas provided a strong foundation for my transition into entrepreneurship. It underscored the importance of community and continuous growth, key elements that have continued to play a significant role in my professional journey.

Matthew Ramirez, Founder, StudyNova

 

Be Tactful and Work Hard

I taught myself how to toe the company line. Coming out of college, I was quite idealistic and opinionated. The latter doesn’t generally bode well in the professional working world. 

So, I had to learn to keep my opinions to myself, put my head down, and work hard. Therefore, my tip is to be remarkable with your work and tactful with your words.

Marc Bromhall, Founder, StorageBuddy

 

Combine Continuous Learning with Networking

Reflecting on my transition from college to the professional world, the journey was both challenging and enriching. After completing my studies in digital communication and media/multimedia at the University of Rochester, I knew that to make a mark in the competitive fields of design and branding, I would need to differentiate myself.

A key strategy that helped me adapt successfully was the integration of continuous learning with real-world application. Throughout my college years and beyond, I was not just focused on acquiring knowledge but also on applying this knowledge in practical settings. This approach allowed me to build a robust portfolio early on.

Networking was another critical component of my transition. I made it a point to connect with professionals across various industries, which opened up opportunities that were crucial for my growth. This proactive approach in building relationships and staying engaged with industry trends helped me navigate through the initial uncertainties of the professional world.

Moreover, my move from Estonia to New York was driven by a desire to be at the center of innovation and creativity. The city’s dynamic environment provided the perfect backdrop for my professional growth, challenging me to continuously improve and adapt.

In sum, my transition was marked by a combination of continuous learning, strategic networking, and a proactive approach to seizing opportunities, all of which were integral in shaping my career path from a fresh graduate to a recognized professional in my field.

Valev Laube, Branding Expert, Designer and Marketing Director, Valev Laube

 

Expand Connections via Professional Circles

My work as a college student was assisted by networking, which made my transition to the workplace more challenging. Socializing with other students and learning from their experiences through industry events and conferences was another strategy I adopted to cope during the pandemic. Through participation in professional circles within my niche, I have expanded my connections and acquired invaluable trade secrets.

Similarly, we did the same for a technology client of ours by arranging and sponsoring industry events for which they provide solutions. We carried out a six-month sales strategy, with the main focus on nurturing professional relationships, which resulted in a 30% increase in new business opportunities and a 20% rise in customer retention rates.

Besides connecting with personnel to grow my business network, networking has provided me with a valuable way to sharpen my skills and gain knowledge in my career.

Kartik Ahuja, Digital Marketer, kartikahuja.com

 

Synchronize Schoolwork with Startup Goals

Transitioning from one chapter to the next in any circumstance can be difficult. With my startup, I found myself in a constant struggle to balance my schoolwork and professional life. For me, the best strategy was to synchronize the two. Because I was so passionate about my mission for Natics, a lot of this naturally reflected in my schoolwork. It was also a great opportunity to network and gain some interest and credibility in the field I was trying to get into from my classmates and professors. As I phased out of classes to focus on Natics full-time, I learned the confidence in networking and putting your ideas out there. Age is your asset, not your weakness.

Zavier Hasnani, Co-Founder and President, Natics Skincare

 

Network Beyond College for Success

Making the shift from college to the working world can be exciting and intimidating at the same time. I found that adopting an attitude of constant learning and flexible agility was essential to effective adaptation. This response is by Erica Tan, the CEO and Co-founder of Best in Singapore. The website’s goal is to produce the most dependable consumer-focused reviews in Singapore.

It can be a daunting experience to graduate from college and enter the profession. Many students are worried about how they will handle the change and feel unprepared. Thankfully, the transition from being a college student to a young professional can be made easier by a few factors.

Continue to network

Your network might be limited as a college student. Nonetheless, since most academics have ties within the fields they teach, you can take advantage of their networks to begin forming professional partnerships. You can network with people at different stages of their careers through the alumni programs offered by many colleges. Never be afraid to proactively build a relationship with them by contacting them on LinkedIn. Lastly, professional associations or clubs in your industry could provide beneficial networking opportunities. Having a network is essential for a successful transition from college to the workplace; don’t be scared to network.

Erica Tan, CEO, Best in Singapore

 

Share Feelings to Transition Smoothly

Every closing chapter of our lives deserves a proper farewell; otherwise, it would be quite difficult for us to move on from that phase and completely adapt to a new chapter. The truth is, I was quite overwhelmed during my transition from college to the professional world, not just because I had a new schedule, but also because I was confronted with newer expectations and responsibilities that honestly felt too far outside of my comfort zone.

I realized that sharing my feelings of fear and anxiety with others was one of the ways I could safely maintain a healthy and positive mindset as I approached the professional world. And by talking to others about my fears and anxiety, I was able to learn that I was not alone in my worries. I also learned that this was only a passing phase.

Letting myself grieve the closing phase of one stage of my life—college—was one strategy that helped me smoothly transition and successfully adapt to my new reality as an employee and a member of a work team. Allowing myself to go through the stages of grief of losing my friends, and losing the freedom that, up until that moment, I never realized was associated with being financially dependent on others and not having to go out and earn a living for myself, helped me properly reorder my priorities and to prepare mentally for the changes I would have to adapt to.

Andrew Johnson, General Manager, Drughelpline

 

Adopt a Consistent Professional Schedule

I tell people to begin operating on a professional schedule as soon as possible after graduation. College can be a bit of a free-for-all when it comes to schedules. Some days you might have an 8 a.m. class, and other days you won’t have one until noon, which means your wake-up times might be different every day.

I suggest getting into a rhythm of going to bed at roughly the same time and getting up at the same time for a few weeks before you start a job. It’ll be less of a shock to your system when your alarm goes off on the first Monday morning of your new job.

Heather O’Neill, Career Expert and Certified Professional Résumé Writer (CPRW), Resume Now

 

Apply College Learning to Diverse Fields

I am one of those people who took their college degree, hung it on the wall, and went to do something completely different. But my tip won’t be to just go and forget everything they’ve taught you in college. On the contrary: Take it all and implement it! This is what I’ve done. With an MA in literature and language, I now work as a content editor and edit mostly HVAC-related content. So, how does Shakespeare help you write or edit HVAC? 

If studied thoroughly, in all the breadth and depth of his thought and language, Shakespeare can help you do just about anything. In other words, a college education isn’t there to teach you any single subject matter (even though it will do that, too). It’s there to teach you how to learn, understand, take any topic, and look at it from different, rich, and unique viewpoints.

Jelena Ciric, Content Editor, BG Electrical & Air Con

 

Build Relationships with Experienced Mentors

Actively seek out mentors or professionals in your desired field. Networking and building relationships with individuals who have experience can provide valuable insights, guidance, and opportunities. Don’t hesitate to ask for advice or feedback from your mentors as you navigate your career path.

You should focus on continuous learning and skill development because it’s crucial.

The professional world is constantly evolving, and staying up-to-date with industry trends, technologies, and best practices can help you remain competitive and adaptable.

Highlighting Internships & Projects: 15 Tips for Students with Limited Experience | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/highlighting-internships-projects-tips-for-students-with-limited-experience/,"Highlighting Internships & Projects: 15 Tips for Students with Limited Experience

Navigating the job market with limited work experience can be daunting for college students, but with insights from seasoned professionals like a VP of Strategy and Growth and an HR director, it becomes manageable. From quantifying internship achievements to creating a project portfolio section, we’ve compiled fifteen invaluable strategies. Discover how to effectively showcase your internships and relevant projects, as advised by top industry leaders.

Quantify Internship Achievements
Showcase Results and Transferable Skills
Dedicate a Resume Section for Projects
Match Skills to Job Requirements

Highlight Applied Skills and Results
Treat Internships as Professional Experience
Include Strong References for Backup
Emphasize the Value Added to Organizations
Craft Targeted Resumes and Cover Letters
Collect and Display Social Proof

Quantify Internship Achievements

When you’re short on work experience, the key to making your internships and projects shine is to focus on the results you achieved. Instead of just listing your responsibilities, explain what you accomplished and the skills you used to get there. 

Did you increase website traffic by 10% through your marketing project? Did you manage a team project that came in under budget? Mention that! Quantify your achievements whenever possible, and show how your work made a real impact. This will grab the employer’s attention and show them you’re a go-getter, even with limited experience.

Kimberley Tyler-Smith, VP of Strategy and Growth, Resume Worded

 

Showcase Results and Transferable Skills

Showing off accurate results is essential for college students who want to showcase their internships and projects, despite having little work experience. 

Even a small project can make a significant impact. 

For example, if you increased network efficiency during your internship, show how much faster it became or how much less time you spent on the network.

Don’t forget to tell stories. Create a resume or portfolio that tells the story of your experiences. 

Tell stories about the obstacles you faced and how you overcame them creatively. Problem-solving and adaptability are two skills employers love to see in you.

And don’t forget to take advantage of any transferable skills you acquired while interning. 

Did you learn how to communicate better with your team? Or perhaps you learned how to manage your time more effectively under tight deadlines. Both of these skills are valuable in any work environment.

Lastly, make sure you’re networking like it’s the 21st century. Attend industry gatherings, network with experts on LinkedIn, and seek out in-depth interviews. There’s never a dull moment when a connection is made.

Don’t forget that experience isn’t about quantity; it’s about quality and relevance.

Laviet Joaquin, Marketing Head, TP-Link

 

Dedicate a Resume Section for Projects

To effectively showcase internships or projects with limited work experience, college students should create a dedicated resume section. Describe projects with quantifiable achievements, use action verbs, and include relevant technical skills to impress potential employers.

Kristina Ramos, Reverse Recruiter, Find My Profession

 

Match Skills to Job Requirements

As a recruiter, fresh graduates who mention job-relevant skills they developed or polished while working on a project or as an intern stand out to me. Therefore, I recommend carefully reviewing the job description and making note of the specific skills, experiences, and qualifications required for the position. You can then reflect on your past internships or projects and identify instances where you have gained relevant skills and experiences that match the job requirements.

On your resume, it’s best to provide concrete examples and details of your accomplishments during your internships/projects, including any relevant metrics or results achieved. For instance, if the job requires experience using certain software that you actually used at your internship, make sure to mention that in bold text under your internship details in the Work Experience section of your resume. Tying your experiences back to the job requirements and demonstrating how they have prepared you for success in the position is key to getting hired when you have no actual employment history.

Joe Coletta, Founder & CEO, 180 Engineering

 

Align Work with Job Description Keywords

The best way to highlight your internship and project experience is by aligning the work you’ve done to the job description, using keywords and mirroring phrases. Emphasize whatever component of your internship or project that matches the job you are applying to, instead of listing out everything you did. 

Also, be sure to focus on the actual work you did, the steps you implemented, and any initiative you took; do not spend precious space describing the project or the internship program.

Mofei Xu, Career Coach, Mofei Xu Career Coaching

 

Develop a Case Study or Portfolio

Create a case study or portfolio feature for the work that was completed during your internship or project. Showing that you are going above and beyond to highlight the relevant experience in a way that can be easily connected to professional duties will help connect the dots for hiring managers.

Jason Miller, Digital Marketing Manager, York University

 

Highlight Applied Skills and Results

Noting internships and fellowships on a resume is a wonderful way to build work experience. Some of these experiences may be rewarded through academic course credit, monetary pay, and/or custom recognition channels. Even unpaid opportunities, aside from volunteer work, contribute as a valuable source when building a professional portfolio of work. Hosting skill sets is fine, but it holds no merit until individuals can prove they’re applying these skill sets in real-life settings. 

When theory translates to application, then there’s a reason for employers to take interest in exploring how these potential candidates can optimally contribute to their organizations. The resume can exhibit different genres of projects that you’ve worked on by stating the objective of the internship/fellowship, sharing the tasks that were assigned during the duration of the commitment, and disclosing lessons learned from the project. Make sure to quantify certain aspects of your work experience so employers can automatically learn the duration of your commitment and understand the measurable metrics that were used to track performance. 

For example, if a student had to produce X reports within a week at their internship, they need to frame the context of their contribution without appearing too nebulous. They were chosen to honor such roles for a reason; therefore, highlight the strengths through skills that were applied and new skills that were acquired. Ambitious employers are seeking candidates who are willing to showcase their ongoing professional development while paying attention to the results of their work.

Sasha Laghonh, Founder, Sasha Talks

 

Treat Internships as Professional Experience

Experience is experience. College students should create a resume highlighting internships and projects in the same way they would a paid position and speak to them in interviews. 

Be mindful of the keywords called out in the job(s) they are applying for and interviewing for when describing responsibilities and skills acquired. The key is to clearly outline what they’ve learned and the successes they’ve accomplished.

Mandy Schaniel, Founder & CEO, Schaniel Consulting Inc.

 

Include Strong References for Backup

Sometimes all you need is a little backup when it comes to quantifying your achievements that were garnered outside of the workplace. This is where references come in handy. Be sure to include references from supervisors, professors, or mentors who can speak to your skills, work ethic, and performance during your internships or projects. A positive reference can strengthen your application and validate your qualifications, making it more likely for you to stand out against others who might be in the same position.

Make sure to mention these references in the interview process and provide them without needing to be asked. This makes it more of a seamless process and creates less work for recruiters.

Michael Banis, Chief Development Officer, Virtue Recovery Centers

 

Emphasize the Value Added to Organizations

As an organizational perspective, we are keen to know more about the internship in terms of how it has been beneficial or added value to the organization. Students often make the usual mistake of explaining the project’s WHAT & HOW, but I would suggest more representation on WHY is required, and it should touch the prospective organization.

Vipul Annadate, Manager HR, K D Aher Building Systems Pvt. Ltd.

 

Craft Targeted Resumes and Cover Letters

College students with limited work experience can effectively highlight their internships or relevant projects by crafting targeted resumes and cover letters. Focus on showcasing specific achievements, skills, and experiences gained during internships or projects, emphasizing relevant tasks and accomplishments. 

Additionally, leverage online platforms such as LinkedIn to create a professional profile highlighting these experiences, engaging in networking opportunities, and joining relevant groups or communities to connect with professionals in the field. 

Finally, during interviews, confidently articulate the value and skills acquired through internships or projects, demonstrating enthusiasm and a proactive attitude toward learning and professional development.

Steven Mostyn, Chief Human Resources Officer, Management.org

 

Collect and Display Social Proof

Use social proof to highlight your projects. Make sure to release the projects and keep them live on a website. 

Additionally, you can launch them on platforms like GitHub/Product Hunt. When you list your project in the resume, highlight social metrics like GitHub stars, Product Hunt rank, or even website visitors, and include a link to your website. This is a good way to stand out from the crowd.

Deepti Chopra, Co-founder, Adaface

 

Build a Strong Personal Brand

I emphasize the significance of harnessing the power of personal branding for college students aiming to stand out with their internships or relevant projects. Crafting a personal brand that resonates with their career aspirations and professional ethos can serve as a beacon for potential employers.

This can be achieved by consistently sharing insights, learnings, and achievements related to their field of interest across social media and professional networking platforms. Curating content that reflects their professional identity and expertise not only showcases their dedication and passion but also positions them as thought leaders among their peers.

By authentically communicating their unique values and visions, students can effectively highlight their potential and readiness for the professional world, even with limited work experience. Thus, personal branding emerges as a strategic tool in bridging the gap between their current academic pursuits and future career goals.

Amit Doshi, Founder & CEO, MyTurn

 

Be Honest About Your Experience

Be honest about your level of experience and don’t try to pad out your past roles if it’s not necessary. Be open about the experience you do have, and be willing to communicate that experience (do not lie or worry about a seemingly lesser amount of experience in your roles).

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Create a Project Portfolio Section

I recommend that college students create a Project Portfolio segment in their resumes or LinkedIn profiles to highlight their internships or relevant projects. This goes beyond merely listing the internships or projects; it’s about storytelling and showcasing the impact of their work through a curated collection of tangible outcomes, learnings, and visual aids.

We often look for candidates who can demonstrate their contributions and learning experiences visually and contextually. For a college student, this could include links to digital portfolios, project websites, or even brief video presentations summarizing key projects undertaken during their internships.

Each project in the portfolio should highlight specific skills used, challenges overcome, and the value added to the project or internship role. For example, if a student worked on a marketing campaign for a new product, they could include campaign visuals, any data on increased engagement or sales, and a brief analysis of what strategies worked and what they learned.

When stepping into an interview, aligning your career aspirations with the company’s vision can be a game-changer. We’ve gathered insights from CEOs and senior consultants, among others, to bring you fourteen strategic tips. From showcasing your strengths and proposing initiatives to asking strategic questions, discover how to resonate with your future employer’s vision.

Showcase Strengths and Propose Initiatives

When aligning your career goals with the vision of a company you are interviewing with, it’s essential to demonstrate how your strengths can contribute to the company’s success while addressing any potential gaps. 

During the interview, emphasize your existing strengths that directly align with the company’s vision and goals. Highlight specific skills, experiences, and achievements that demonstrate your ability to contribute to the company’s success. For example, if the company is focused on innovation and you have a track record of implementing creative solutions in your previous roles, emphasize this as a strength that you can bring to the new company. 

By showcasing your existing strengths, you can illustrate how you are well-positioned to support the company’s vision from day one. Consider the potential gaps or areas where the company may benefit from your expertise. During the interview, propose specific action items that you can focus on to enhance the company’s business value and profitability. This could involve outlining potential projects, initiatives, or strategies that align with the company’s vision and can contribute to its growth. 

By presenting concrete action items, you demonstrate your proactive approach and commitment to driving the company toward its strategic goals. The key is to showcase not only your qualifications and experience but also your strategic thinking and proactive mindset.

Yemisi Iyilade, Senior Consultant, YEMISIIYILADE.COM

 

Analyze LinkedIn Profiles and Company Culture

Your best insight into the company’s culture and beliefs is not coming from their website; that’s an advertisement. The most honest places where they portray themselves are on the LinkedIn personal profiles of the principals and officers and on the company’s profile page. Read what they are saying there about themselves and their adherence to the company’s mission, both on the surface and deeper between the lines. Notice how they post news about the company and other material to share with their industry. Determine if they lead the industry with original thought or follow along with little value added. 

You want to be part of a mover-and-shaker company, not a laggard. Before your interview, get the names of everyone you will meet in HR and in management, and review their personal profiles to beef up the questions you can ask them about themselves, their history there, and promotions within the company, their perspective on why you may want to work there that is not obvious from their LinkedIn presence. Make this interview a dual conversation, with foreknowledge and prior research, not one where they ask you all the questions.

Marc W. Halpert, LinkedIn coach, trainer, marketing consultant, connect2collaborate.com

 

Inquire About Promotion Tracks

I recommend that candidates should always ask what the promotion track looks like for the job they are applying for. If the role they would have one to two promotions down the line aligns with their career goals, then they will be even more excited to join the company and motivated by their work. On the flip side, if it isn’t of interest to them, then they might have issues staying motivated and finding their work rewarding.

Corey Schwitz, CEO & Founder, Skydog Ops

 

Become an Aspirational Archaeologist

Beyond superficial sound bites, genuine alignment springs from marrying your unique growth trajectory to an organization’s transformative path forward. Early on, I coached candidates to parrot mission statements verbatim. Quickly, I realized leaders crave contributors who deeply internalize values as personal guideposts for impact. Now, I advise job seekers to become archaeologists of aspiration—excavate beneath polished positioning to unearth the raw human hopes propelling a company’s existence. 

Scour interviews, press releases, and even Glassdoor reviews to decode their distinct dialect of purpose. Then, trace how your specific skills and experiences can accelerate their evolution. Perhaps you’re a data scientist passionate about ethical AI, pursuing roles with healthcare startups pioneering equitable diagnosis algorithms. Articulate how your blend of technical chops and social consciousness uniquely equips you to responsibly scale their products while safeguarding patient trust. 

The key is positioning yourself as a co-creator, not just an employee. Ignite imagination around how you’ll materially advance their mission through the vehicle of your own career vision. Alignment shines when individual and institutional ambitions share a horizon.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-founder and CEO, EchoGlobal Tech

 

Match Career Goals with Corporate Values

Start by searching the “About Us” section of the company’s website and looking for their Corporate Values. This list of values will let you know what the company thinks is most important in a prospective candidate for hire. (They are actually telling you what to focus on during the interview.) The list will also closely align with the company’s corporate vision.

Look for ways that you can match up your career goals with these values and the corporate vision.

For example, if the number one value is “Quality,” ask yourself, “If the company hires me for this position, in what ways would I be able to improve quality for them?” Think about ways that you have accomplished that in prior work that you have done. Have those examples ready when you walk in for the interview!

Doug Staneart, CEO, Fearless Presentations

 

Be Honest About Personal and Professional Seasons

Consider your life situation and the season of your life, both professionally and personally. Be honest if you are re-entering a career after taking care of your kids for the past five years, if you are a caregiver for an aging parent, if you are in a transition in your life such as a divorce, a state move, or any other situation you are currently in. The employer will appreciate your openness and honesty upfront, as well as how they can work with you to align the workload and your schedule. 

There will always be changes in the seasons of life, so make sure that your employer knows you are committed to bringing your best and contributing to the growth and development of the company. Whether you are just starting in your career or advancing in it, don’t be afraid to tell the company what you hope to accomplish in your career. Make sure you ask questions during the interview that will help you maintain a healthy work-life balance and allow you to advance within the organization.

Olga Kovtun, Marketing Coordinator, HRPro

 

Validate Company Vision with Employee Insights

I think the better challenge is to first look at the vision of a company and learn everything you can about that company—you can start with the basics like a website or LinkedIn Company Page. But the more important exercise is to talk to a few people who actually work there via networking; ask them their thoughts about the company’s vision. See how their answers compare to the company’s marketing of it. 

Once you have validated what they say and what others confirm it’s really like, if that opportunity is of interest to you, now it’s important to see how it stacks up to your career goals. Is it a fit? Let’s assume it is for the sake of an upcoming job interview.

When you go through your STAR or PAR examples, what ways can you use examples that align with the company’s vision from what you have done in the past? When you prep for questions about yourself and what you want, how can you craft authentic answers that relate to your goals and their vision? Interviews are about selling yourself, so by doing the research to know what your audience is looking for, it next becomes your job to focus on selling yourself into that equation.

Working with a coach to hone in on this strategy can be really beneficial because most candidates are too surface-level with their approach; one needs to go deeper and more technical in their answers while being true to themselves to stand out.

Nikki Ryberg, MHRLR, CPRW, GCDF, Career Coach, Ryberg Group, LLC

 

Engage in Early Skills Alignment Conversations

Candidates can align their career goals with the vision of the company they are interviewing with by engaging in early conversations that uncover skills or competencies needed to assist in carrying out the vision of the company at the level of the employee. 

For example, if interviewing for Amazon for a customer service position and knowing their vision is, “Our vision is to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online,” the employee may pursue podcasts such as “Creating Disney Magic: Lessons in Leadership, Management, and Customer Service” or similar podcasts to help develop skills that are synergistic with the vision and pertinent to the customer service role.

Celeste Davis, CPO

 

Create a Vision Integration Map

My best tip is to create a Vision Integration Map.

First, thoroughly research the company’s vision, mission, and recent initiatives. Then, draw up a map that visually connects your past experiences, skills, and aspirations with various aspects of the company’s vision. This could be a mind map or a simple chart. The idea is to create a visual representation that clearly shows how your career trajectory and achievements align with and can also contribute to advancing the company’s strategic goals.

For example, if the company is committed to sustainability and you’ve worked on projects that reduced waste or improved energy efficiency, highlight these experiences in your map. If innovation is a core part of the company’s mission, detail how your innovative thinking or past projects have led to successful outcomes. This method allows you to enter the interview with a straightforward, compelling narrative demonstrating alignment and actively contributing to the company’s future.

Presenting this Vision Integration Map during your interview can set you apart as a candidate who has not only done their homework but also creatively thought about how they can be an asset to the team. It showcases your analytical skills, ability to synthesize information meaningfully, and genuine interest in contributing to the company’s success.

This helps candidates demonstrate a deep alignment with a company’s vision, making it clear they’re not just looking for any job, but a role in which they can actively participate in the company’s journey and contribute to its long-term success.

Laurie Hyllberg, Vice President, Kinsa Group

 

Research and Share Passionate Examples

Research. Check out the hiring company’s mission statement, About page, their work, social posts, etc., and try to find common ground with your own career goals and interests. You can even go one step further and share a direct example with some specificity to impress further while trying to bring aspects you’re passionate about into the mix. The more passionate and committed you come across, the higher your chances of landing the job become.

Christopher Thoma, Head of Media, CareerAddict

 

Highlight Skills that Complement Company Values

During the interview, be prepared to discuss how your career goals align with the vision and values of the company. Highlight specific areas where your skills, experiences, and values complement those of the company. 

For example, if the company values innovation and you have a track record of introducing new ideas or processes, emphasize how you can contribute to the company’s culture of innovation.

Terry Jackson, COO

 

Sell What the Buyer Is Buying

Candidates can align their career goals with the vision of the company they are interviewing with by asking questions during the interview. In other words, you want to sell what the buyer is buying. However, you can only do that by asking follow-up questions during the interview to ensure that you have all the information. 

For example, when an interviewer asks why you’re interested in the role, ask them to share more. This will allow you to align your responses further within the process, including your career goals.

Valerie Martinelli, MPA, CEO , Valerie Martinelli Consulting, LLC 

 

Weave Career Story with Company’s Vision

And then, it is the golden tip for the candidate: how to align career goals with the vision of the company with which the interview is taking place. The candidate should see the strategic opportunity during the course of the interview so as to show how they can be aligned with the company’s mission and goals.

This should come through by immersing oneself deeply in understanding the mission statement, the values, and the larger objectives that the company has previously set. By understanding these key facts, a candidate will be in a better position to explain in a manner that shows how their career aspirations aren’t just in cooperation but in collaboration with the company’s vision.

Then the candidates cleverly weave their career story into the fabric of the company’s vision during the interview itself, not to state future goals as classic teacher questions suppose, but to show how the few goals they do have are in favor of the path the firm could be on. This perhaps means linking certain skills or experiences to an individual that could directly correlate with the goals of the company.

This will further be achieved when candidates ask questions that bring to the forefront how the vision is achievable with their involvement. Actually, this not only points out the zeal and interest in seeking to understand the vision of the company but also underscores the eagerness to have a significant contribution in achieving that vision.

Viktoriia Prydatko, HR and Tech Recruiter, HireDevelopersBiz

 

Research Company and Ask Strategic Questions

Before the interview, thoroughly research the company’s mission statement, values, and long-term goals. Understand what they stand for, what they aim to achieve, and how they differentiate themselves from competitors. This will provide you with insight into their overall vision. 

Then, throughout the interview, take the opportunity to ask questions that further demonstrate your alignment with the company’s vision. Inquire about upcoming initiatives, challenges, or opportunities that relate to your career goals. This shows your genuine interest in contributing to the company’s success in areas that matter to both you and the company you are interviewing with.

Showcase Real Weaknesses with Improvement Strategies

Years back, the practiced answer was usually something along the lines of “I work too hard” or “I’m a perfectionist.” We tended to look for answers that would make the companies like us. Now, too many people have adopted that approach, and companies are turned off by the lack of vulnerability these answers offer. This puts candidates in a tricky spot because being too honest could backfire.

I think answers that involve specific examples of a few areas where things come harder but also offer ways they’ve improved (systems, processes, courses, etc.) are great. I also think using real weaknesses but then selling why they are actually a strength can be good, too. 

For instance, I’m too impatient at times, which can lead to impulsive decisions, but it also means I never miss a deadline and am always early to meetings. I have learned this about myself and now put parameters in place, such as strategies X and Y, to ensure I do the due diligence I need to before making a critical decision.

An answer like this is real; it can show the positive aspect of the trait and the real-life workaround one implements because of it.

Nikki Ryberg, MHRLR, CPRW, GCDF, Career Coach, Ryberg Group, LLC

 

Lead with Authenticity and Highlight Improvement Steps

Honesty is a powerful tool when answering difficult interview questions, including those about your “weaknesses” or areas of opportunity. Although you want to be careful not to mention being bad at something that is listed in the basic job requirements, you don’t have to try to turn your weakness into a strength either. Instead, lead with authenticity and highlight the steps you’re taking to improve.

If you’re struggling to come up with weaknesses, turn to your performance evaluations to see what feedback you’ve received in the past. You can also look to those around you for feedback. This can be as simple as asking, “I’m preparing for an upcoming job interview. Can you please share a few of my greatest strengths as well as my biggest weakness?”

Dr. Kyle Elliott, Founder & Tech Career Coach, CaffeinatedKyle.com

 

Combine Humor with Active Solutions

When you’re hit with the “weaknesses” question in an interview, it’s a golden opportunity. Start with a little humor, maybe confessing your love for puns or your knack for turning any situation into a sitcom-worthy joke. Then, get down to the nitty-gritty by admitting something genuine, such as overcommitting due to enthusiasm or being too critical of your own work. 

Wrap it up by highlighting how you’re actively working on these areas, whether it’s through time-management techniques, seeking feedback, or honing your skills. It’s about being authentic, a little funny, and demonstrating your dedication to self-improvement.

Crystal Clark, Communications Manager, City of Tampa

 

Frame Weakness in Context of Proactive Improvement

When faced with the “weakness” question, the best approach is to be candid while framing it in the context of proactive improvement. Start by choosing a genuine area where you’ve faced challenges, but make sure it’s not a critical skill for the role you’re applying for. Then discuss specific steps you’ve taken to address this weakness. 

For example, if you struggle with public speaking, you might want to say: “I’ve always found public speaking to be stressful, which I know is important for teamwork and leadership. To improve, I’ve joined a local Toastmasters club to communicate my ideas clearly and with confidence.” This approach will show honesty, your willingness to keep working on yourself, and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities for growth.

Bayu Prihandito, Founder, Psychology Consultant, Life Coach for Men, Life Architekture

 

Focus on Learning and Growth Over Cliché Answers

Flip the answer to what you hope to learn or improve. Instead of the cliché answer “I’m a perfectionist,” try: “I’m learning that progress matters more than perfection.” Instead of “I work too hard,” try: “I had to recognize that what I thought was working too hard was actually me being inefficient, so I worked on my time management and organizational skills.” What you are doing here is showing self-awareness and growth versus saying what you think they want to hear.

Mathew Fox, Founder, Embedded Talent

 

Demonstrate Commitment to Enhancing Weaknesses

Candidates can approach the “weaknesses” question in a way that doesn’t truly admit a weakness. Demonstrate that you are trying to enhance your “weakness” through your commitment to self-improvement with a plan to turn it into a strength and how it could benefit others. Be candid in your responses because it demonstrates humility and the fact that you’re not perfect, but that you are learning and willing to take action to improve yourself when needed.

Valerie Martinelli, MPA, CEO, Valerie Martinelli Consulting, LLC 

 

Use Feedback to Show Growth and Continuous Improvement

I believe what employers are really trying to get at when they ask the ‘tell me your greatest weakness’ question (which could really be worded in a much better, more behaviorally based way) is to determine where a candidate needs to grow or what areas they will need support in, and also to see how a candidate has acted on those areas. 

A great way to answer this is to give an example of previous feedback you’ve received from a leader, manager, or supervisor on an opportunity to improve, and then showcase what steps you have taken to act on that feedback. 

For example, you could say, “In my previous performance reviews, an area of growth for me has been time management. I’ve made strides to improve in that area by leveraging my electronic calendar better, using an app to manage my to-do list, and taking a virtual course on prioritization.” This gives the employer real-life, behaviorally based answers and an example of an area you need to work on, as well as demonstrates your ability to accept negative feedback and act on it to ensure you are meeting expectations. 

Overall, I believe it is key for a candidate to approach this question in a way that demonstrates that “weaknesses” are really just opportunities for continuous improvement, and that you are always striving to be a better version of yourself. Everyone has areas to work on, so don’t be ashamed or try to guess what the employer wants to hear. Give an honest, real-life example and demonstrate how you have worked on that opportunity, and you will have nothing to fear!

Heather Kerr, Human Resources Manager

 

Share a Journey from Recognizing to Overcoming Weakness

A good friend of mine, when asked in interviews to identify his biggest weakness, would answer, “chocolate.” Typically, the interviewer and my friend would share a laugh and move on. Sometimes, they’d share a laugh, and then the interviewer would ask him to answer seriously, which he did.

Whether you want to recycle the chocolate joke or not, it is a good idea to be prepared for all questions likely to be asked in an interview, including identifying your biggest weaknesses. When you’re discussing weaknesses, choose ones that are real, explain how you came to understand that you needed to get better, what you did to get better, and how that paid off. 

You want the interviewer to understand that you used to have that weakness but no longer do, but you can’t just say that as it is too conclusory. You want to convince them, and to do that, you need to take them on that little journey about how you came to realize you had a problem, how you fixed it, and how that’s been beneficial to your employers.

Steven Rothberg, Founder and Chief Visionary Officer, College Recruiter

 

Present Weaknesses with Actions Taken and Results

This is a question where some humility is expected, but it’s also a chance to showcase resilience. You don’t want to highlight a weakness that is essential to the job in question, so be mindful and cautious with what weakness you select and present to hiring managers.

Use this as an opportunity to share an actual instance of this weakness, with actions taken, and the results to demonstrate how you overcame that scenario. In doing so, you’ll demonstrate your commitment to self-improvement and to tackling tough situations.

Christopher Thoma, Head of Media, CareerAddict

 

Emphasize Team Role Awareness and Strengths Commitment

There is an argument that you’re never really going to become great at the things you’re not good at. And that, therefore, you should focus on becoming the best you can be at the things that come naturally to you and that you enjoy, or don’t mind doing. 

For example, if your brain wants to explode whenever you look at a spreadsheet, or you want to fall asleep whenever anyone starts talking conceptually, then there’s not much point in trying to mold or force yourself to be someone who works with numbers all day or has to work on conceptualizing as a primary function of their role. The best teams are the ones where each person knows what their strengths are and is okay with other people taking control of their gaps. 

A team will not work if everyone is trying to do everything. So, sharing this honesty with a potential employer shows that you have awareness of what strengths you can bring to the company, shows awareness and willingness that you are able to communicate and ask for help from other team members, and shows that you understand what you can commit to improving so that you can be the best at what you’re best at.

Hannah Ray, Life, Career + Business Coach, TAKE Coaching Amsterdam

 

Detail Specific Strategies for Addressing Growth Areas

To help your interviewer understand how you’re approaching a perceived weakness (or a growth area in general), share specific examples of strategies you’ve tried.

If time management is a challenge, you could list a few ways you’ve tried to restructure your schedule, build consistent habits, prioritize effectively, or project-manage your work. Explain what did and didn’t work for you (and if you have time, explain why).

In the end, try to tie it back to the job you’re interviewing for. Talk about how your new skills and insights will help your performance. Your interviewer isn’t expecting perfection—they want to know how you’re investing in yourself to be better at what you do.

Alex Lahmeyer, Founder, DEI Consultant, and Career Advisor, Boundless Arc

 

Embrace Vulnerability and Plans for Strength Conversion

Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable.

The truth is that candidates must first be aware of the fact that they have weaknesses to be able to give an honest answer to this question, much less one that showcases their commitment to self-improvement. Therefore, candidates just have to understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong with letting their vulnerability show at this point, because weaknesses are naturally part of our essence as human beings, so there is really no point in answering the weakness question with an intention to cloud your true weakness.

By far, one of the most effective ways that candidates can approach the weakness question and showcase honesty and commitment to self-improvement is to take a confessional mode and not be afraid to show their vulnerability. This is, however, not to say that they should sulk and dwell so much on the negatives of their weaknesses and fail to make mention of the plans they have for becoming better, but that they should not be afraid to share how their weaknesses have affected them in the past because this way, they demonstrate self-awareness that is committed to self-improvement.

Also, by embracing their weakness and having enough courage to be vulnerable during the job interview, they communicate their willingness to learn, grow, and convert this weakness into major strengths.

Tim Hastings, General manager, Top Rated Law

 

Provide Context to “Bad” Weaknesses with Solutions

It’s all about context. As an employer, I’d much rather hear a “really bad” weakness that has context rather than an artificial response. If someone lists “lazy” as their weakness, it sounds really bad, but if the context is, “After a long day of programming, I often feel too lazy to cook a full meal from scratch,” it’s definitely relatable. If “that’s why I like to do ingredient prepping on the weekend” is added, suddenly this makes the statement both relatable, honest, and solution-oriented.

Thomas Strobl, Founder, Fugoya

 

Utilize STAR Method to Outline Weakness and Improvement

The truth is that demonstrating competence and willingness to make improvements, even in the areas of their most profound weakness, will always work in the best interest of job candidates. 

One way that candidates can approach the weakness question in a way that showcases honesty and commitment to self-improvement is to approach the question using the STAR method. Because this method takes a four-part approach to questions, it affords candidates the opportunity to present a particular situation when their weakness threatened their efficiency in a workplace setting, the task that needed to be completed, the action that they took, and the result that was achieved.

What makes this an effective way to approach the weakness question is the fact that it allows candidates the opportunity to paint a vivid picture of the steps that they have taken to eliminate the limiting and self-stagnating effects of their weakness. 

By selecting a particular instance when their weakness challenged their ability to achieve a desired result, and strongly emphasizing the actions that were taken to mitigate this weakness, and then going on to highlight the results of these mitigative actions, candidates would be successful at marketing themselves as competent, while also showcasing honesty and commitment to self-improvement.

Andrew Johnson, General Manager, National Drug Helpline

 

Combine Candid Feedback and Self-Awareness

I have always approached this sort of question with humor and a smile. “You mean, ‘Well, I probably work too hard?’” I then move on to some candid feedback and perspective. 

For example, “What some people consider a weakness, others may consider a strength. I have a hard time hiding my expressions when I am dealing with someone who is bogging down progress for the sake of wanting to look important. Some people would call that a positive—being candid—while others would call it undiplomatic.” 

I created a quirk list years ago. I’ve shared it with people when they join my team. There’s no reason to waste time, energy, and emotion trying to figure me out when I can give you the list. “Here I am. I’d be happy to share it with you.” That approach has always worked for me. If the interviewer doesn’t like that approach, then I probably shouldn’t be working there anyway.

12 Effective Ways to Research a Company Before an Interview | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/12-effective-ways-to-research-a-company-before-an-interview/,"12 Effective Ways to Research a Company Before an Interview

In preparation for your next job interview, we’ve gathered insights from top professionals, including HR executives and CEOs, to offer you the most effective strategies for researching a company. From analyzing employee social profiles to utilizing LinkedIn for company insights, explore the twelve comprehensive strategies these experts recommend for a deep dive into your potential employer’s world.

Analyze Employee Social Profiles
Observe Active Social Media Channels
Check Crunchbase for Financial History
Conduct Informational Interviews
Research Interviewers and Company Staff
Study the Company’s Digital Footprint
Review Website, Reports, and Employee Insights
Utilize Glassdoor for Candid Feedback
Leverage Official Channels and Employee Reviews
Read Between the Lines of Company Communications
Compare Company with Industry Competitors
Utilize LinkedIn for Company Insights

 

Analyze Employee Social Profiles

Drawing from my dual background as an HR professional with five years of experience and an HR writer with four years under my belt, I’ve developed a keen eye for assessing company cultures and work environments beyond the company’s LinkedIn page and traditional review sites like Glassdoor. 

A key strategy is to closely observe how employees discuss their work environment and culture on their personal LinkedIn profiles. This approach offers authentic insights into the company culture, beyond what is officially presented.

For instance, recurring mentions of overtime, burnout, or high stress levels among employees are clear red flags, indicating a potential culture of overwork. Conversely, posts celebrating team achievements, work-life balance, or professional development suggest a positive, supportive environment. Such nuances provide valuable, candid insights into the company’s real culture, guiding you toward making a well-informed decision about your potential workplace.

Maheen Kanwal, HR Executive, B2B Tech SaaS Copywriter, Founder, Call to Authority

 

Observe Active Social Media Channels

Assess the socials that they’re most active on so that you can really get a sense of what makes them ‘tick’, and what they’re likely to respond positively to. For example, if they have an office dog, then you can share your mutual love of dogs, or if they’re working on a certain project that they’ve shared, then you can comment on that project specifically.

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Check Crunchbase for Financial History

If you plan on working for a start-up, a scale-up, or a rapidly growing organization, I strongly recommend looking at Crunchbase to see their financial history. A great many privately owned companies survive almost entirely on venture capital, and the availability of this capital is paramount to their continued existence. 

Crunchbase outlines a company’s investment history, providing powerful insight into where the money is coming from. Consequently, when applying for jobs, it’s always worth keeping an eye on how much funding they have received, and for two reasons. Free-flowing funding means that salaries are likely to be paid as promised, as they are unlikely to run into financial problems in the short term. But also, if venture capital firms are interested in investing, this suggests the organization has something special going on, which is a positive sign.

Oliver Savill, CEO and Founder, AssessmentDay

 

Conduct Informational Interviews

One strategy I highly recommend for thoroughly researching a company before an interview is to leverage informational interviews with current or former employees. While online resources provide valuable information, speaking directly with individuals who have firsthand experience with the company can offer unique insights and perspectives.

Start by reaching out to your professional network or utilizing platforms like LinkedIn to identify individuals who currently work at or have previously worked for the company. Politely request a brief informational interview where you can ask questions about their experiences, company culture, values, and any other relevant aspects.

During the informational interview, focus on open-ended questions that encourage detailed responses. Inquire about the company’s mission, recent projects or initiatives, workplace environment, team dynamics, and growth opportunities. Additionally, ask about challenges they’ve faced and how the company addresses them, as well as any advice they have for potential candidates.

Listening attentively to their responses can provide valuable insights beyond what you might find in official company materials. Pay attention to recurring themes or sentiments, which can help you better understand the company’s culture and values.

After the informational interview, take notes and reflect on the information gathered. Compare it with other research sources, such as the company’s website, news articles, and employee reviews, to gain a comprehensive understanding.

Daniel Jorge, Senior Consultant, EC1 Partners

 

Research Interviewers and Company Staff

At the end of the day, companies are made up of people. It’s super important before an interview to do research about the people you’ll be speaking with. Just five minutes of Googling can do a lot… Look at their LinkedIn page (maybe you have connections or education in common) and find something interesting to discuss.

I’ve interviewed hundreds of people, and many don’t even look at our company website before speaking with us. Those that do just a little bit of research about the company and me really stand out and show they go the extra mile!

Corey Schwitz, CEO & Founder, On-Demand Salesforce, Hubspot and Revenue Ops Customization, Skydog Ops

 

Study the Company’s Digital Footprint

A unique strategy for researching a company thoroughly before an interview is to study its digital footprint beyond the traditional scope of its official website and social media profiles. This involves a deep dive into various online platforms and resources where the company’s indirect presence can provide insightful context about its culture, reputation, and operational nuances. Here’s how to approach this:

Participate in or review discussions on industry-specific forums and online communities related to the company’s field. These platforms can offer unfiltered insights into the company’s reputation within the industry, emerging challenges it might be facing, and the innovations it’s known for.

Websites like Trustpilot, Yelp, or even product review sections on e-commerce platforms can provide a wealth of information about the company’s products or services, customer satisfaction levels, and how the company handles complaints or feedback. This research can explain the company’s customer service ethos and product quality.

Companies in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, etc.) should check reports and filings with regulatory bodies. These documents can shed light on the company’s compliance history, financial health, and any regulatory challenges it may have faced. This information can be particularly insightful for understanding the company’s operational rigor and market standing.

Vaibhav Kakkar, CEO, Digital Web Solutions

 

Review Website, Reports, and Employee Insights

Before your interview, check the company’s website to learn about what it values and who leads it. Look at reports and financial statements for information on its finances and performance. Check news and social media for recent projects and how the company is perceived publicly. Read what employees say on sites like Glassdoor to understand how people feel about working there. 

Also, check LinkedIn for key people and connect with current or past employees if possible. This will give you a good understanding of the company, and during the interview, you can show that you know about its goals and values.

Eva Toledo, Senior Researcher, Kepler Search Pte Ltd

 

Utilize Glassdoor for Candid Feedback

I would highly recommend using Glassdoor or any other tool that will provide candid feedback about an organization. While organizations can pay to try to have bad reviews removed, the on-the-ground feedback and how an organization responds can show a lot.

In my consulting practice, I was burned by this previously. A client that I was going to work for had really bad reviews about the culture, the owner, and red flags that would have been a tip-off of things to come. However, I ignored the data in front of me. They turned out to be very much like the reviews, and I should have heeded the warnings. I ended up leaving the client after about six months.

Ben Madden, Owner, HR Action LLC

 

Leverage Official Channels and Employee Reviews

I highly recommend utilizing the company’s official channels, particularly its website and published materials. Start by reviewing the About Us, Mission Statement, and Values sections to grasp the organization’s foundational principles and culture. Examine annual reports and financial statements for insights into the company’s financial health and performance. 

Additionally, explore recent news articles, press releases, and social media profiles to understand current developments and employee interactions. Leveraging employee review platforms like Glassdoor can provide valuable perspectives on the work environment. Connecting with current or former employees on platforms like LinkedIn can offer firsthand insights. 

This comprehensive approach ensures that candidates not only understand the business’s objectives and financial standing but also its culture and employee experiences, facilitating a more informed and tailored interview preparation.

Steven Mostyn, Chief Human Resources Officer, Management.org

 

Read Between the Lines of Company Communications

The most important thing is to read between the lines on a company’s website and public communications to figure out what they really care about. Study their About page, press releases, leadership bios, and so on. Look for signs that they value innovation, people, or social responsibility in a way that appeals to you. Understanding what motivates a company will help the conversation flow better in interviews, beyond just your qualifications.

Additionally, check out news articles and reviews to get balanced inside perspectives from employees. Approach learning about a company as an interesting research project where no detail is too small. Doing this groundwork will allow you to assess if it’s a good fit, align values, and show how you can contribute.

I’ll admit I didn’t always do enough research early on and stumbled in interviews. But being your real self, focused on helping people more than profits, makes connections that the right organization will recognize.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-founder and CEO, EchoGlobal

 

Compare Company with Industry Competitors

One very effective tactic when researching the company you are about to interview with is not only studying the company’s history, products, services, and culture but also the company’s competitors to get a broader view of the industry and how the company stands against those competitors.

You can find company intelligence in industry reports, news articles, or in financial statements. This can help you to understand the competitive dynamics, current market trends, or present challenges. A good way to impress the interviewer can be to refer to their competitors and how they might be able to take account of this in the job you are applying for. It would show that you can think strategically and that you tend to be proactive.

An interviewer may ask you to describe some ways you might contribute to the company if you got hired. It’s a way of asking, “What can you do for us?” It can also be a way to determine your motivation and commitment to the company. Answering this question can help build your credibility and show the interviewer that you are excited to help the company grow. Some possible ways you might be able to contribute to the company that you’re interviewing for include bringing in new trends, being knowledgeable about the company, and being innovative.

Blake Smith, Marketing Manager, ClockOn

 

Utilize LinkedIn for Company Insights

LinkedIn provides a wealth of information about companies, including their mission, values, products or services, and recent news or updates. Additionally, you can explore the company’s culture page on LinkedIn, which often includes employee testimonials and insights into the work environment. 

Another valuable aspect of LinkedIn is the opportunity to leverage your professional network. If you know anyone, past or present, who has worked at the company, you can reach out to them for insights or information. 

Connecting with current or former employees can provide you with firsthand perspectives on the company’s culture, work environment, and overall experience. They may be able to share valuable insights that go beyond what you can find through public sources. This knowledge will help you prepare for your interview and demonstrate your genuine interest in the company.

Lead with Tactful Influence

I got the position of Team Lead quite early. After university, I got a job at a company as a junior developer, and after three years, I was entrusted with managing my team. There was an employee on this team who had worked at the company much longer than I had. He believed that the position should have been his. 

As a result, I was faced with outright neglect and a lack of any respect on his part. Combined with the fact that this was my first managerial position, I had a very difficult time at the beginning. Consequently, I developed two approaches for working with this employee. 

Firstly, I did not directly express my ideas at first but carefully led him to them, so that the problematic employee had the feeling that these were his ideas. In this case, he made a lot of effort to implement them. Secondly, I carefully moved our relationship out of the “parent-child” zone (the funny thing is that he was the “child”) into the “adult-adult” zone. I tried to maintain our “adult-adult” communication as long as possible during conversations. 

As a result, after a few months, I noticed that he stopped perceiving me as hostile, and we began to truly cooperate, rather than try to prove which of us was more authoritative.

Viktoria Dolzhenko, Team Lead, Itez

 

Embrace Emotional Intelligence

Own it, even if you didn’t create it. My clients are the boss. They are high-achieving, hugely successful, and demanding. 

One of my favorite stories is from my earliest years in business. A client called in a rage because she was lost on her way to our meeting. I talked her through it, and when she arrived, she was very worked up, and it was clear no matter what I said, I could not win. 

This was not a great start. She wouldn’t allow me to explain that our email thread included her acknowledgment of our meeting location and instructions on how to find it. Her argument was that she was too busy to read emails. She looked up my website; she went to the mailing address. 

As the owner of the business, it was my fault that she was lost, and no details aside from that mattered. Like many of my clients, this woman had graduated in the top 5% with her Harvard MBA. She was now a venture capitalist with the ability to choose where, when, and with whom to work. I took a deep breath and realized that I could learn something from her. Allowing myself to be challenged in this way was like getting a masterclass in Emotional Intelligence. 

Without resistance or emotion, I thanked her for bringing this to my attention. Then I suggested we move on. This experience was one of many that taught me so much. But it’s memorable because she not only remained a client for over a decade, she referred so many new clients my way that I once sent her flowers. Which she did not acknowledge. And that was, and still is, okay.

Emily Dills, Founder, Seattle Nanny Network, Inc.

 

Utilize Humility and Accountability

Genuine humility has a surprisingly disarming effect on others. When faced with a challenging co-worker or burdensome boss, resist the temptation to embroil yourself in a battle of wills. Instead, employ a hint of interpersonal jujitsu by leveraging your relative newness and willingness to learn.

Simply acknowledge the tension, accept accountability for your contribution, and ask how you might adjust your behavior to enhance the relationship. Most will be impressed by the professionalism and compelled to follow suit.

For the dense few who fail to offer a similar adjustment, your action affords you the right to a direct request. Simply say, “This relationship is important to me, and I’m happy to do X. I believe we’d achieve even greater results if you did Y.” The strategy underscores the natural give-and-take in all effective relationships and makes it hard to refuse your ask.

Tim Toterhi, CHRO, Plotline Leadership

 

Navigate Micromanagement with Strategy

My first boss was an absolute micromanager. I was creating social media content for a medium-sized business. I was the entire social media department, and the whole marketing team was three people. The CEO of the company insisted on reading, giving feedback on, and approving every single post I put up. He also wanted to handle any direct replies to customers himself, even though this was part of my job description. 

Meanwhile, the actual head of the marketing department had performance standards for me—including creating a minimum number of posts for each platform we operated on each day. The CEO’s meddling basically made this impossible. Finally, I explained the situation to the marketing head, and she and I decided to simply let the CEO do what he wanted. 

As long as we kept a paper trail, she would be able to defend my productivity at performance review time. This was enough to keep me employed, but I was never going to earn a raise in an environment like this. Luckily, my immediate boss was able to write me a stellar reference letter, and I was gone within six months.

Nick Valentino, VP of Market Operations, Bellhop

 

Personalize Team Member Support

Early in my career with a digital media company, when I was promoted to team lead of our guest-post writers, I had to handle two difficult team members who were having challenges with the many details involved in writing, submitting, and correcting their articles.

I handled each by reviewing their work to find the mistakes they would commonly make, then creating a personalized “cheat sheet” for each of them to ensure they checked off certain items before turning in their work.

I also coordinated with a team member who excelled at training, and she created a training video for each writer specific to their needs and then held a training session with them.

Through these efforts, we were able to help one team member overcome anxiety with technology, and the other to consistently use mandatory reference guides and online tools.

Michelle Robbins, Licensed Insurance Agent, Clearsurance.com

 

Stand Up Against Intimidation

At the beginning stage of my career, there was this particular coworker who was a big bully. He was so unproductive, difficult to work with, disrespectful, and he felt he could get away with everything. I guess his huge, masculine physique contributed to this.

I had to work extra hard to make up for his inadequacy because we were in the same section at work, and I didn’t want him to be the reason for our falling behind.

I was enduring his unprofessionalism and trying my best to stay clear of him until the day he did something that hit my last nerve. He deleted every single document I had been using the past month to compile, and he told me straight to my face that there was nothing I could do about it.

For the first time in our history of working together, I stood up for myself. I had never done it before because of how scared I was of him, but that day, I decided I had had enough. To this day, I don’t know where the strength or confidence came from, but I stood up against him and told him how much of a horrible person he was, how I was never going to tolerate his disrespect, and how I was going to get him fired if he didn’t take his work seriously.

For the first time, he looked subdued and harmless, and that was when I realized he was just a random, lazy bully who was only good at making empty threats. He never tried bullying anyone again after that incident, and shortly after, he resigned.

I learned a major lesson that day, and that was to always stand up for myself.

Grace Chisom, Marketing Manager, Check CPS

 

Set Limits with Grace and Humor

I’ve learned how to handle difficult relationships with managers and coworkers. I learned leadership skills from running a revolutionary resin-injection subsidence repair company.

Over the years, I’ve learned to graciously set limits, which is essential to good leadership. Politely and firmly setting limits is essential when dealing with disruptive or poisonous behavior. Instead of constant micromanaging, try weekly progress updates. This preserves my health and improves the workplace.

Humor is a valuable ally in complex work relationships. With the right timing and tone, a joke or lighter quip can release tension and build togetherness. Sarcasm and degrading humor can backfire and worsen problems.

My method of appealing to challenging employers or coworkers’ higher selves works well. By gently reminding them of our shared aims, ideals, or their work’s positive impact, negativity fades. This strategy fosters collaboration and a positive outlook, promoting achievement.

In the dynamic world of Subsidence Ltd., where precision and innovation are key, my unique and effective workplace problem-management tactics have survived and built a resilient and successful team. These real-world lessons emphasize the necessity of subtlety, empathy, and strategy in overcoming professional challenges.

Matthew O’Sullivan, CEO, Subsidence LTD

 

Gain Perspective on Generational Differences

The clash between a young employee and an older boss is as old as time. It’s a generational clash and a power clash, and it can end in resentment and bitterness. Like many young men, I was also full of energy, ideas, and ideals, and I did not appreciate being ordered around or shot down by my much older boss, whom I thought was overly “safe,” cautious, and unimaginative. There were many conflicts because of it. 

What helped me navigate this in the end was realizing that none of this was about me. This guy wasn’t jealous and threatened by my youth and exuberance, as I thought in my delusional, cocky youth; this was his business, his life’s work, and he was cautious. He was protecting his work. Understanding that changed my entire perspective and approach.

Rick Berres, Owner, Honey-Doers

 

Employ Kindness and Psychological Insight

We’ve all had at least one awful job that came with a difficult boss or coworker, or both. However, these jobs are a great opportunity to learn about psychology and human nature. 

Something about me really poked my manager right in the insecurity, and he took it out on me. I was never brash or braggadocious. He just knew that I was going to be successful, and that he was going to still be a manager at the same restaurant, so he took it out on me. I simply let it roll off my back and killed him with kindness. It’s hard to be terrible to someone who goes out of their way to be kind to you. 

Eventually, he stopped trying to goad me, and I quit shortly thereafter. However, for someone who finds themselves stuck with a difficult coworker in a job you plan to keep, study psychology. Figure them out. Understand them fully, and you can push the right buttons to keep them under control.

Kam Talebi, CEO, Gigli

 

Confront Issues with Professionalism

Difficult is a broad term when defining a co-worker’s or boss’s behavior, because some people label a person as difficult when they fail to receive favor or a desired outcome from their work colleague. 

If a person’s work ethic or personality is challenging to coexist with, then take an opportunity to meet with them one-on-one to inquire if everything is okay. If they’re actively listening, they’ll ask why you’re inquiring about them. Allow that opportunity to share specific examples of their behavior and how it’s impacting the work environment and the progress of other team members. 

If you don’t address the challenge head-on, then you’ll invite more problems to resolve over time. Be professional, look them in the eye, and state your concerns by addressing them by their first name, so there’s no misunderstanding of whom you’re addressing in the moment. Suggest how they can make a better effort in adjusting their behaviors to positively contribute to the work environment.

If they become combative or defensive by adhering to poor coping mechanisms that can border on harassment, then escalate your matter to the appropriate members in the organization. 

If they ignore the matter, whether it’s big or small, then take matters into your own hands by seeking external counsel, because not all organizations are competent at doing their job. Context matters. Reflect upon the difficult and/or sensitive situation that needs attention prior to taking any action.

Sasha Laghonh, Founder, Sasha Talks

 

Communicate Proactively with Empathy

In my early career, I encountered a challenging situation with a boss who had a very direct and occasionally dismissive management style. To manage this effectively, I adopted a strategy of proactive communication and empathy. Instead of reacting defensively to criticism, I tried to understand their perspective and expectations better. I scheduled regular meetings to discuss project goals and my progress, ensuring we were on the same page.

One specific instance that stands out was when I presented a detailed project plan, anticipating questions and addressing potential concerns upfront. This approach not only demonstrated my initiative and competence but also helped build a more constructive working relationship.

By maintaining professionalism and focusing on open communication, I was able to turn a challenging situation into a learning opportunity, gaining valuable insights into effective communication and resilience in the workplace.

Daniel Bunn, Director, Incensen

 

Find Common Ground and Seek Guidance

Early in my career, I encountered a challenging dynamic with a colleague whose approach clashed with mine. We did not see eye to eye on how we should tackle various projects, and it became a very strenuous work environment. 

Instead of focusing on our differences, I emphasized finding common ground and aligning our goals for the project. I could express my ideas more effectively by listening to and acknowledging their viewpoints and opinions. Patience was crucial; I allowed space for mutual respect to develop gradually.

Additionally, I sought guidance from people I respected in the company to gain insights into navigating such situations professionally. It is inevitable that you will encounter these types of situations during your career. However, experiencing this kind of conflict taught me the power of empathy, patience, and constructive dialogue in managing complex professional relationships.

Sacha Ferrandi, Founder and Principal, Source Capital

 

Initiate Open Conversations on Collaboration

I once held an administrative role where I supported several executives, and one of the executives was very demanding. In my first three months on the job, they never once expressed gratitude, even when I went above and beyond. I also saw them treat other members differently, which made it tough for me to feel engaged at work.

One day, I gathered the courage to sit down with them to provide feedback. I shared that I wanted us to have a strong working relationship but that I didn’t feel my contributions were valued. Despite the power dynamic, they were receptive and apologized for leaving a negative impression.

The next day, they thanked me after completing a small task for them, and our relationship improved from that point onward. This situation underscored the importance of having an open conversation about collaboration and working styles—a topic I cover in my work today.

Alex Lahmeyer, Founder and DEI Consultant, Boundless Arc

 

Address Negativity with Direct Communication

Early on in my career, I had a coworker who often had a negative attitude that affected the overall workplace environment. Rather than reacting impulsively, I chose to approach the situation strategically. I started by trying to understand their perspective, seeking insight into what might be causing their negativity. 

However, when this approach didn’t lead to any improvement, I considered it necessary to address the issue directly. I initiated a calm, respectful conversation, expressing my concern about the impact of their negativity on the team’s morale. This conversation opened a door for better communication, leading to improved relations and a more positive work environment. 

This experience taught me the importance of empathy, patience, and direct communication in managing challenging relationships.

Matthew Lake, Managing Director, Guardian Safe and Vault

 

Establish Clear Professional Boundaries

I employed the strategy of proactive boundary-setting. Understanding the dynamics, I respectfully established clear boundaries for tasks and communication. By diplomatically asserting limits while remaining open to collaboration, I preserved personal and professional space, creating a more balanced and respectful interaction with my challenging colleague or boss. This approach cultivated a healthier working relationship based on mutual understanding and respect for boundaries.

Maxi Extrakt, CEO, Fort Lauderdale Pergolas

 

Involve Management in Conflict Resolution

Early in my architecture career, I faced the challenge of working alongside a colleague whose borderline anger-management issues would unexpectedly flare up, especially in situations lacking accountability. This coworker’s confrontational behavior over seemingly trivial matters posed a significant challenge. 

Despite multiple attempts at conflict resolution and personal appeals, the situation persisted until involving senior management became necessary. Through extensive discussions and mediation, it became apparent that our colleague’s approach was incongruent with the organizational ethos, leading to the realization that their methods couldn’t align with our team’s dynamics. Eventually, this colleague made the decision to depart, recognizing the incompatibility of their approach with the organization’s culture and expectations.

Handling this challenging relationship taught me the importance of patience, perseverance, and involving higher authorities when necessary. It highlighted the significance of exhausting all avenues for conflict resolution and seeking senior management intervention when individual efforts fall short. This experience emphasized the value of organizational alignment and the crucial role of leadership in resolving interpersonal challenges that hinder productivity and harmony within a team.

Andrew Chung, Founder, Best Cafe Designs

 

Manage with Openness and Empathy

During the initial phases of my professional journey, I encountered numerous obstacles when it came to navigating challenging relationships with supervisors and colleagues. 

However, over time, I learned various approaches that allowed me to effectively manage these challenging relationships. One approach that proved to be effective for me was maintaining open and honest communication. Whenever I had an issue or disagreement with a difficult boss or coworker, I made sure to have a conversation with them about it. This allowed me to express my concerns and also understand their perspective, creating mutual understanding and respect. Another approach I found useful was practicing empathy. It’s important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and reasons for behaving in certain ways. 

By putting myself in their shoes, I was able to better understand where they were coming from and find a way to work together. I also learned to pick my battles. Not every disagreement or issue was worth fighting over, especially when it came to working with difficult individuals. I had to learn to prioritize and choose which conflicts were worth addressing and which ones I could let go.

Embrace Your Unique Story

When it comes to job interviews, don’t be afraid to embrace your uniqueness. You bring a blend of experiences, skills, and perspectives that no one else can. Remember, your individuality is your greatest asset, and only you can tell your story. Confidently and transparently share how your unique qualities will add value to the team.

After a long career in one profession, I decided I wanted to pivot in a completely different direction. It was important for me to reflect on what set me apart and how my skills aligned with the roles I pursued, even though the career path was very different. I was able to show up to interviews being true to myself while confidently sharing my unique narrative and how it complemented the organization I was hoping to join.

It’s not just about fitting into a role; it’s about showing how the role fits you.

Komita Liggans, ACC, Coach and Content Creator, GK Liggans

 

Highlight Your Personality via Storytelling 

As an experienced recruiter, my top tip for candidates aiming to maintain authenticity and be themselves during a job interview is to focus on storytelling.

Share real-life examples from your experiences, emphasizing challenges you’ve overcome and achievements you’re proud of. By weaving narratives into your responses, you not only provide concrete evidence of your skills but also allow your personality to shine through. Be genuine in your communication and ‌share the lessons you’ve learned from both successes and setbacks.

This approach not only showcases your professional capabilities but also ensures that the interviewer gets a true sense of who you are and what you bring to the table.

Hanna Borysenko, HR Director, Elai Inc.

 

Balance Professionalism With Authenticity

I know you can feel pressured to be super professional in an interview. And sure, an interview is definitely a performance where you need to bring your A-game. But it’s also important to be yourself. (Or at least bring the parts of your personality that you want to bring into your professional life.) Why? Because if you land this job, you’ll be doing it for 5 days a week, 8 hours a day (at least!). If you’re some fake version of yourself in a job interview, and they hire that version of you, now you have to keep showing up playing that character!

You can decide how authentic to be in an interview. But if there are parts of your personality that you need to express while working, it’s okay to show that in your interview. For me, that’s humor. If jokes aren’t welcome in your office, I don’t want to be there, either. So you can bet I’ll try to make a joke in an interview to see how that lands! So my tip? Start by giving yourself permission to be authentic.

Pat Fligge, Director of Temple Professional Network, Temple University

 

Make Connections Through Vulnerability

Sharing moments of vulnerability, when appropriate, such as discussing challenges you’ve faced and how you’ve overcome them, can help you feel more like yourself. When you discuss challenges you have faced in your past jobs, it can help you make more meaningful connections with those who are interviewing you. 

Always maintain professionalism and focus on the lessons learned and growth achieved through those experiences, and share this with them as well. It can show your determination and critical-thinking skills, which are helpful during an interview!

Renan Ferreira, Head of Communications and Director of Sales, RealCraft

 

Practice Authenticity, Dismiss Doubts

When under stress, it’s challenging to let our true personality shine through, which is particularly problematic during job interviews. Practice, however, makes perfect. The more interviews you participate in, the easier it becomes to be transparent. 

To prepare for showing your honest self, consider seeking a voice coach who specializes in “elevator pitches.” Rehearsing your answers to typical questions in the mirror, much like actors do, will boost your confidence. Nerves can also stem from “impostor syndrome,” the feeling of not being qualified for the position. It’s important to dismiss such doubts, build self-assurance, and concentrate on the reasons why you are the right fit for the job. 

If there is a skill you lack, be upfront about it and have a plan for how you will address this gap. Remember, interviewers have a challenging task, and a brief acknowledgment of your appreciation for the opportunity to meet can help to break the ice and make a positive initial impression.

Lilia Koss, Community Manager, Facialteam

 

Candidly Discuss Growth Areas

One tip for showing authenticity is by being candid about your limitations. It shows you have a realistic understanding of yourself and are ready to keep growing, which is highly valued in any professional environment. When discussing areas for improvement, I recommend framing them in learning and development. 

For example, if there’s a skill you might lack, mention how you’re actively and practically working on it. This approach will highlight your honesty and also a proactive attitude toward self-improvement. However, it’s important to balance this by also discussing your strengths and how they align with the job’s requirements. This demonstrates self-awareness and a strategic mindset, which prove that you’re both aware of your limitations and also focused on leveraging your strengths effectively.

Bayu Prihandito, Certified Psychology Expert, Life Coach, Founder, Life Architekture

 

Foster Genuine Connection with Self-Awareness

Focus on genuine self-awareness and honesty. Employers appreciate and respect authenticity and just want to get to know the real person behind the resume. 

If your career has evolved unconventionally, or you’ve had to take a career break for personal circumstances, be honest. Avoid giving rehearsed or overly polished answers; instead, speak from the heart. Use your own words, and let your personality shine through in your responses. 

By establishing a genuine connection with the interviewer and showing a genuine interest in the company and the role, you’ll leave the interview knowing that you have been true to yourself. If you are the right fit for the company, the employer will recognize it.

Katharine Gallagher, Founder, Personal and Professional Growth, katharinegallagher.com

 

Trust Your Intuition

Follow your intuition. Pay attention to your gut feelings about the job and the people interviewing you. If something doesn’t feel right, it may not be the right fit for you. Celebrate that self-awareness rather than turning it into a frustrating moment or feeling like you wasted time. Realize that each interaction is getting you closer to where you belong.

Kelli Anderson, Career Coach, Texas General Insurance

 

Avoid Guessing Interviewer’s Mind

The trick to authenticity in interviews is to avoid turning the interview into a Keynesian beauty contest.

A Keynesian beauty contest is a hypothetical beauty contest where judges are rewarded for choosing the most popular faces among other judges, not necessarily those they find most attractive. The economist John Maynard Keynes likens this situation to investors buying securities which they believe others will invest in, rather than securities that have intrinsic value.

Consequently, when an interviewee attempts to tell the interviewer “what they want to hear,” they are ignoring their authentic self and are simply trying to second-guess the interviewer’s criteria.

Instead, you should answer questions in a way that feels effective to you, not what you suspect may be effective to your interviewer. This way, you can focus 100% of your attention on providing good responses while staying true to who you are.

Ben Schwencke, Business Psychologist, Test Partnership

 

Assess Mutual Fit Honestly

During a job interview, consistently remind yourself that this is a mutual evaluation process. Recognize that the interview is not just about convincing the employer that you are the right addition to their team; it’s also about assessing whether the company and team align with your values and career goals. 

Throughout the interview process, focus on responding in the most genuine and truthful manner. Avoid the temptation to provide answers that you think the interviewer wants to hear. Instead, share your genuine experiences, skills, and perspectives that are relevant to the position. This will not only allow the interviewer to get a true sense of who you are and the value you bring to their team, but it will also help you determine if the role and company are right for you.

Heidi Hauver, Chief People Officer

 

Prepare for Natural Conversation

Being yourself is great for helping your interview manager recognize you as a person. However, it doesn’t equate to admitting that coming late is your routine; this is plainly an unprofessional attitude. Be authentic in your role and expertise so that it doesn’t put overwhelming pressure on you when you join the company. 

The key to being genuine with your manager is to avoid over-preparing for the interview. The massive storage of already prepared responses will push you away from exposing your inner being for work. Canned responses will put you at risk of responding like a robot. Prepare in general—for example, look for the questions but don’t memorize them. You will allow yourself to flow with the conversation.

Janice Hawkins, Group Sales and Marketing Manager, Future Care Group

 

Showcase Your Side Hustle

My tip is to highlight your “side hustle.” Discuss a personal project or entrepreneurial endeavor you’re passionate about outside of your main career. This not only showcases your authenticity but also your drive, creativity, and the ability to balance multiple commitments. It demonstrates that you’re a well-rounded professional with a genuine passion for your work, both inside and outside the traditional business sphere.

Josh Ladick, President, GSA Focus

 

Lead With Your Values

When preparing for an interview, it’s important to define your values. Often, there’s a focus on leaving a positive impression, which can lead to altering one’s personality unintentionally. Leading with your values helps maintain authenticity.

For instance, if collaboration is a key value, frame responses to highlight collective successes with coworkers or problem-solving with other stakeholders. Being conscious of your values allows them to naturally influence your answers.

This approach is also useful for formulating questions for the interviewer. For example, asking, “I’ve found that collaboration is important to me in a work environment. As a remote-first company, how do you use technology to foster collaboration?”

Alex Lahmeyer, Founder and DEI Consultant, Boundless Arc

 

Connect as Individuals

Avoid giving generic answers that could apply to anyone, because if you sound and act like everyone else, you will come across as phony. Instead, focus on connecting with the interviewer as a person and enjoy the process. Smile. Speak with your hands. Show that you are delighted when answering their questions because you are enjoying the conversation.

Jeff Altman, Global Job Search Coach, The Big Game Hunter, Inc.

 

Arrive Early, Stay Composed

My advice is to ensure that you arrive early, with enough time to calm down and rehearse the main points you want to cover.

There’s nothing worse than feeling prepared and then having to rush on your way to the interview, which can often lead to being flustered and making mistakes that you otherwise wouldn’t!

Tracey Beveridge, HR Director, Personnel Checks

 

Back Claims With Evidence

Be prepared to have examples to back up claims of previous achievements or previous work. This doesn’t mean an extensive history, but rather, if you’re claiming to have achieved “x” or “y,” then it does help to have some form of evidence to support your claims.

Wendy Makinson, HR Manager, Joloda Hydraroll

 

Stay Honest, Remain Calm

Research shows that recruiters decide whether they want to hire you within the first 90 seconds of an interview. Chances are, they won’t delve deeply enough into your resume to care about minor exaggerations. 

However, most people become nervous about their lies being caught while the recruiter scans their resume. You may be caught in a lie if the recruiter focuses on something you exaggerated and questions you about it. Remaining calm and casual is the key to acing an interview, and the recruiter will notice a change in your demeanor. 

You’re much better off being honest. If you’re afraid of inexperience, shift the focus of the interview to your strong qualities.

Perry Zheng, Founder and CEO, Pallas

 

Use Humor to Ease Tension

Flipping the script usually helps set a better tone than the standard interrogation. The best way to do this, in my experience, is to acknowledge the awkwardness to the interviewers. 

I’ve had a potential hire crack a joke, starting with “I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve brought you all here today…” before explaining that he just wanted to clear the air a bit so we could all talk more normally. This was extremely impressive and very effective in managing a stressful situation, so I recommend this approach to others.

Dragos Badea, CEO, Yarooms

 

Take the Pressure Off Interviews

It sounds bad if I tell you not to take it too seriously, but—I would say that’s the number one thing that takes the pressure off. The best way to subvert the importance of an interview is to try to get another one. It’s like dating—if you’re only setting one date with one person, there’s too much riding on it. You want options, to take the edge off.

Do the same with job interviews—if you know there are options and alternatives waiting for you, you can afford to be more relaxed, more yourself. And ironically, you will perform much better when it’s not that serious.

Rick Berres, Owner, Honey-Doers

 

Be Comfortable in Your Clothes

One aspect that I think a lot of people don’t consider is being comfortable in your clothes. By this, I naturally don’t mean that you should show up to the interview in your pajamas; instead, you should wear your interview clothes for a few days ahead of time. 

Unless you’re regularly wearing a suit or formal wear, you’re going to be uncomfortable, and your body language will not be the same as usual. This does come through to the astute interviewer, so being comfortable in your formal wear is a great way to help you be yourself.

Onno Halsema, CEO, Contentoo

Utilize AI for Personalized Video Messages

I use Maverick AI to send personalized video messages. I record a use case (I have several different ones for business development and one thanking for joining my talent community) video. Then, I give a quick recap of my most relevant experience and address any action items or any skills (software) I may not have had or weren’t strong with after having learned them. 

I let them know I’ve taken the initiative to bridge the skill gap and list what all I have learned to do and how to do those things. Video leaves an impression. The AI will swap out the first name of whoever you are addressing in the video using your voice, so you can record once but still send to Bob, Steve, and Frank, and each will see the same video but at the very beginning you will say their name to add that personalized touch. You can send 1,000 video links out per month for as low as $50-$100.

Matthew Jones, Senior IT Recruiter, VIP Staffing

 

Record a Thank-You Video

Surprisingly, candidates don’t always follow up after an interview, so doing so can really help you stand out. To differentiate yourself, consider recording a thank-you video. A short, 2-3 minute video message can add a more personal touch to your thank you and make a memorable impression for a hiring team navigating a full inbox. 

In your video, you can share that you enjoyed the discussion, express your appreciation for the hiring team’s time, reinforce your understanding of the role by summarizing key discussion points, highlight aspects of the role that align with your interests, skills, and abilities, and take some time to explain how you plan to contribute to the success of the company. 

You can finish your message by sharing your genuine enthusiasm for the position and let the team know that you are looking forward to hearing from them on the next steps.

Heidi Hauver, Chief People Officer

 

Add Value with Prompt Email Follow-Up

In my experience of interviewing thousands of candidates, it has always impressed me when they follow up. 

However, the truth is that very few candidates follow up. Therefore, doing so will not only differentiate your application but also give the impression that you are highly motivated. Being a more memorable candidate is even more important if an employer has many choices and is struggling to decide.

Prompt follow-up by email is recommended. Express gratitude for the employer’s time, convey that it was a pleasure to meet them, and express your interest in the job. If the employer mentioned further assessments or meetings, reiterate that you’re keen to complete these at their earliest convenience.

Last, you may wish to add value like: “During our conversation, you mentioned [Challenge/Objective]. I’ve been thinking about it and wanted to share some thoughts on how I could contribute…”

Geoff Newman, Founder, Starget.co.uk

 

Create a Relevant Mini-Project

In a hyper-competitive talent research sphere, it’s not just skills that set you apart, but the nuances of your approach post-interview. 

One intriguing method would be to craft a bespoke mini-project or short analysis pertinent to a challenge mentioned during an interview faced by the prospective company. Rather than a traditional thank-you note, send a succinct presentation or document that demonstrates your proactive approach to problem-solving. This not only exhibits your initiative but offers a tangible glimpse of the value you’d bring.

Moreover, integrate feedback or insights from the interview into this project. This showcases your attention to detail, active listening skills, and eagerness to adapt, making you a memorable candidate in a sea of conventional follow-ups.

Lou Reverchuk, Co-Founder and CEO, EchoGlobal

 

Send a Personalized Book Recommendation

After my interview, I sent the interviewer a personalized book that resonated with our discussion, accompanied by a note explaining its relevance and how it reflected my perspective on the role. This thoughtful gesture not only underscored my commitment and passion but also provided a tangible representation of my values and approach, setting me apart as a candidate who goes the extra mile.

Rob Blum, CEO, Blumsafe

 

Provide Recruitment Process Feedback

If you’re determined to get a job after the interview, any respectable company would appreciate your feedback on the recruitment process. 

Sending your opinion about it might seem risky and controversial. However, we need to remember that modern companies’ values are based on the culture of feedback. Sharing your ideas proves your familiarity with the job market’s values. It will also present you as a confident and outspoken person, aware of their competencies. Make sure your language is professional, but avoid being too authoritative. Of course, you should consider such a move only if you have positive feelings about how you were approached as a candidate. 

In other words, balance your expertise with humility. Address various steps of the recruitment process to prove your engagement and dedication to it. Only some candidates summon up the courage to adopt this strategy, so you will undoubtedly set yourself apart from the competition.

Martyna Szcześniak, Community Expert, MyPerfectResume

 

Polish Interview Answers Post-Interview

Consider showcasing your dedication to ongoing growth and refinement to set yourself apart from other candidates. Specifically, revisit the questions that were asked during the interview and provide more polished answers after thoughtful consideration through a follow-up email. 

This approach not only underscores your genuine interest in the position but also highlights your ability to adapt and continually enhance yourself. Demonstrating your commitment to self-improvement and reflective thinking can make a lasting impression on the hiring team.

Trendy Tan, Marketing Senior, Kepler Search

 

Include Relevant Project in Follow-Up

Distinguishing yourself in your follow-up after a job interview all depends on the seeds you planted during the interview itself. During the interview, find the right time or steer the conversation towards a specific project you completed that showcases your skills and experience. 

During your email follow-up, you can include links or attach your project so that the interviewer can learn more. This will create a lasting impression as it provides direct evidence of your qualifications.

Adam Shlomi, Founder, SoFlo Tutors

 

Summarize the Interview in Follow-Up

One time, I actually received a summary of the interview, which kind of blew my mind as it was over an hour long and touched on quite a few subjects. The thank-you email basically summarized everything we discussed and even included some additional clarifications beyond what was said to shore up some points in their resume and experience. 

It clearly took quite a lot of work, not to mention a prodigious memory and set of communication skills, so it really stuck in my mind.

Dragos Badea, CEO, Yarooms

 

Send a Handwritten Thank-You Note

One unique way to make a lasting impression post-interview is by sending a handwritten thank-you note. It showcases gratitude and illustrates your dedication and the extra effort you’re willing to put in. 

While it might seem old-fashioned, such a gesture stands out precisely because of its rarity. Receiving a physical note in an age of digital communication can leave a significant impact, making you memorable in the eyes of the interviewer. This personal touch can set you apart from other candidates and demonstrate your genuine interest in the position.

Michael Sena, CEO and Lead Analytics Consultant, Senacea Ltd.

 

Share a Relevant Article Post-Interview

One creative or unique idea for following up after a job interview is to find an article that relates to something that was talked about in the interview. 

The next step could be to send a note that says something along the lines of: “I came across an article today that reminded me of the discussion we had around X. I’d love to know your thoughts.” 

This approach is a great way to stay top-of-mind, provide something of value to the interviewee, and to follow up without the typical “I wanted to follow up” email.

John Mooney, President, IML

What Front-End Interview Questions Should I Ask a Developer? | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/what-front-end-interview-questions-should-i-ask-a-developer/,"What Front-End Interview Questions Should I Ask a Developer?

From assessing company culture fit to learning about a candidate’s ability to problem solve, here are 10 answers to the question, “What are good front-end interview questions to ask a front-end developer?”

What is Your Coding Personality?
How Do You Keep Up With the Latest Trends and Technologies?
What Front-End Languages Are You Proficient In?
What Is Your Experience With Developing Website Accessibility?
How Do You Maintain User-Friendly and Efficient Web Interfaces?
What’s Your Process for Debugging Cross-Browser Compatibility Issues?
What Have You Accomplished for a Client that You Are Most Proud Of, and Why?
How Will You Ensure the Website is Search Engine Friendly?
What is Your Approach to Optimizing Website Performance?
Assessing Critical Thinking With a Real-World Problem

 

What is Your Coding Personality?

One of the best front-end questions to ask is, “How would you describe your own personality in coding?” This question reveals a lot about the candidate’s approach to work and how they work with others. It is also a great way to assess whether the candidate would be a good fit for the company culture.

Matthew Ramirez, CEO, Paraphrase Tool

 

How Do You Keep Up With the Latest Trends and Technologies?

Staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies in front-end development is crucial to being successful in this field. When interviewing a front-end developer, I would ask them about their approach to staying current with the latest developments in the tech industry. 

Some excellent resources that they might mention could include online forums and communities, such as Reddit or Stack Overflow, industry-specific blogs, and publications, or attending conferences and webinars. 

Make sure that the developer you hire commits to ongoing learning and development and has a solid plan in place for keeping up with new trends and technologies.

Natalia Brzezinska, Marketing and Outreach Manager, ePassportPhoto

 

What Front-End Languages Are You Proficient In?

I can say that one of the best questions to ask is about their current and future programming languages. The question should be: “What front-end languages are you proficient in, and which ones would you like to learn in the future?”

It’s important to assess their current skill set and see if it aligns with the needs of your company, but it’s equally important to gauge their openness to learning and growing in their career.

When asking this question, it’s important to allow the candidate to showcase their expertise and highlight their areas of interest. By understanding their current language proficiency and future aspirations, you can gauge how they will fit within your organization and determine if they have the potential to contribute to your team’s success.

Remember, a great front-end developer is someone who not only has a solid foundation in programming languages but also has the drive and motivation to continue learning and growing in their career.

Luciano Colos, Founder and CEO, PitchGrade

 

What Is Your Experience With Developing Website Accessibility?

Accessibility is a critical aspect of front-end development that often gets overlooked, so one important question to ask front-end developer candidates is “What is your experience with accessibility, and can you describe how you ensure your websites are accessible to users with disabilities?”

Accessible websites allow companies to reach a wider audience and help make the web a more inclusive place. A suitable candidate will describe specific accessibility guidelines and how they apply them in their work. They should also be able to show an understanding of the importance of accessibility and the impact that inaccessible websites can have on users with disabilities.

Samuel Johns, CPRW and Career Counselor, Resume Genius

 

How Do You Maintain User-Friendly and Efficient Web Interfaces?

Discussing their familiarity with responsive design principles and experience implementing frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation can provide a comprehensive understanding of their technical proficiency. Also, inquiring about their approach to handling cross-browser compatibility issues allows you to gain insight into their problem-solving skills and adaptability. 

Exploring their knowledge of JavaScript libraries, like jQuery, and modern front-end tools, such as React or Angular, can help you assess their ability to stay current with industry trends and deliver innovative solutions.

Michael Lazar, Executive, ReadyCloud

 

What’s Your Process for Debugging Cross-Browser Compatibility Issues?

Ask the candidate to walk you through their process for debugging cross-browser compatibility issues. Front-end development entails creating user interfaces that should be accessible and responsive across a multitude of browsers and devices. 

Problems with the app working on different web browsers can negatively affect a person’s experience and stop the app from succeeding. It’s critical to assess how candidates approach cross-browser compatibility issues to determine if they have the right technical and debugging knowledge and skill set to mitigate these issues.

Will Baker, Founder, Skirtings R Us

 

What Have You Accomplished for a Client That You Are Most Proud Of, and Why?

This question prompts the candidate to recall a time when they helped solve a problem for a client or company. This can be very telling of the bottlenecks they can help solve for your website, which is especially important in the e-commerce space. 

Answering this question also gives the candidate a chance to shine in their response, and their reaction can help employers gauge their passion for their work.

Nabeel Abdullah, CEO, Sapphire

 

How Will You Ensure the Website is Search Engine Friendly?

It is crucial to building a website that potential customers can easily find on search engines like Google. Front-end developers often skip this and focus on aspects that are visible to users, but not search engine crawlers (for example, missing meta tags, crawlability of the website).

Eimantas Aukstikalnis, Founder, LaptopRadar

 

What is Your Approach to Optimizing Website Performance?

This question is important because website performance is a critical factor in delivering a good user experience, and front-end developers play a key role in optimizing website performance.

A strong front-end developer should be able to show a solid understanding of website performance optimization techniques like these:

– Minimizing HTTP requests by reducing the number of files and scripts loaded on a page

– Optimizing images by compressing them and using appropriate file formats

– Using efficient CSS and JavaScript code to reduce page load times

– Implementing caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) to improve website speed

– Analyzing website performance using tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights or WebPageTest

Harsh Verma, SEO Head, Codedesign

 

Assessing Critical Thinking With a Real-World Problem

A great front-end interview question that you can ask a front-end developer is to present them with a real-world problem that requires a good amount of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. 

An example is: “Imagine I have given you a design mockup for a responsive website.

The designer has used non-standard fonts and complex animations. How would you approach implementing this design to ensure the website is accessible, performs well, and is compatible with different browsers and devices?”

This question would allow the candidate to showcase their understanding of better UX with accessibility, performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility while demonstrating their ability to think critically and adapt to various design challenges.

What Are the Best Questions to Ask in a Final Interview? | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/what-are-the-best-questions-to-ask-in-a-final-interview/,"What Are the Best Questions to Ask in a Final Interview?

From “What do you like about working here?” to “Is this enough money for you to walk away?,” here are 14 answers to the question, “What’s the best question to ask in a final interview?”

What Do You Most Enjoy About Working Here?
What is Your Turnover Rate?
How Do You Handle Redundancy?
What Qualities Would Make Someone Successful in This Position?
What is the Typical Career Path for Someone in This Role?
If I Were to Join the Team, What Advice Do You Have for Me?
What Can I Do to Improve My Chances?
How Do You Handle Conflicts With Colleagues or Supervisors?
What Makes You a Good Fit for Our Culture?
What Are Your Long-term Career Goals?
Name Some Self-development Habits Which Help in This Role
How Do You View Success?
What is Your Company’s Competitive Edge?
Is This Enough Money for You to Walk Away from the Opportunity?

 

What Do You Most Enjoy About Working Here?

Asking the interviewer what they enjoy most about working at the company is a great way to gain insights into the company culture, work environment, and management style. The answer to this question can also give you a sense of what makes the company unique and why employees are happy working there.

This question also serves as an opportunity to build rapport with the interviewer and show that you are genuinely interested in the company and its employees.

Joe Flanagan, Founder, 90s Fashion World

 

What is Your Turnover Rate?

While in previous interviews, you may have asked about what the job entails, try to get to the heart of the workplace environment in later interviews as your chances of being hired increase. 

Of course, it’s always exciting to receive a job offer, but it’s also important to ensure that you can envision yourself being truly fulfilled working at this company for the long term. Knowing about the company’s turnover history will give you an idea of how happy its employees are.

Marilyn Zubak, Marketing Lead, Snif

 

How Do You Handle Redundancy?

As a recruiter, a big part of my job is guiding candidates through the interview process, so I think I can provide some advice to your readers. My favorite question to ask in a final interview is, “If we eliminated this job tomorrow, what would you do?”

Technology is moving faster than ever before. No position is truly safe; in fact, entire departments have been whittled down overnight thanks to a single leap forward in the software we use.

Top talent knows that what they offer a company goes far beyond a specific set of responsibilities. I’m looking for an answer that speaks to inherent value—that dedication to growth that makes forward-thinking inevitable and sees changes to the status quo as an opportunity, not a loss.

Rob Reeves, CEO and President, Redfish Technology

What Qualities Would Make Someone Successful in This Position?

This question not only shows that you have a sincere interest in the job, but it also gives you an understanding of what expectations are—so that you have more insight into whether it’s worth pursuing the role further. 

Likewise, steering the conversation towards discussing future growth opportunities presents yourself as an individual with ambition who will get even better at their job over time.

Mariusz Michalowski, Community and Career Expert, Spacelift

 

What is the Typical Career Path for Someone in This Role?

By asking this question, you can analyze the trajectory of someone in this role. Based on the answer of the employer, you can identify what challenges you will have to face while on the job.

You can determine whether you should stay in the job for a long time or not after analyzing whether there is career advancement. 

Moreover, it also expresses your interest in career growth, which is crucial. The interviewer can also understand that you are looking for a long-term role in a company, which is good for employee retention.

Saikat Ghosh, Associate Director of HR and Business, Technource

 

If I Were to Join the Team, What Advice Do You Have for Me?

I like this question because it 

helps to set you up for success when integrating into the company, 
if you ask a few interviewers, their answers could vary, yet still be helpful, and  
gives you further insight into the organization’s operations. 

I’ve asked this question as an interviewee myself and I remember the response was “be curious.” Throughout my tenure at that particular company, I used this advice to not be afraid to share ideas, recommend different approaches to solve problems, and ask insightful questions.

Megan Dias, Career Services Coach, Parsity

 

What Can I Do to Improve My Chances?

If you hear the answer to this directly from the interviewer, you should definitely take advantage of that experience to learn as much as you can. They can share valuable insight into the process and how you can best navigate it as a candidate.

If you ask something like “What are small things I can do to improve my chances of being hired?” the interviewer can provide valuable insight into what they are looking for and maybe even what they are seeing from other candidates.

I would ask them this question and take notes on exactly what they say. Find out what they are looking for in these situations and do whatever they say. Even if it doesn’t help this time, it might help in the future.

Shaun Connell, Founder and CEO, Credit Building Tips

 

How Do You Handle Conflict With Colleagues or Supervisors?

Asking a candidate this question gives you a glimpse into how they work around professional relationships to ensure that team harmony remains intact. The candidate should show they can communicate effectively despite there being a conflict. Such a candidate can easily resolve conflicts and take constructive criticism that helps them improve their output in the long run.

Liam Liu, Co-founder and CMO, ParcelPanel

 

What Makes You a Good Fit for Our Culture?

By the final interview, you should already know whether the candidate can do the job itself. If you are still unsure of their basic competence, the interview process must be entirely redesigned, as this should have been determined well before the final interview.

However, culture fit is a far more elusive concept and is best reserved for the final interview itself. Naturally, even the most competent and skilled employees could become mismatched if they do not fit the organization’s culture, guaranteeing attrition down the line.

Asking the candidate why they would be a good culture fit serves many purposes. Firstly, you can see whether they have done their homework and actually understand your organization’s culture. Second, you can assess whether they believe themselves to match your culture and its values. Last, a sound answer highlights an appreciation for organizational culture fit, suggesting that they take this aspect of employee engagement seriously.

Ben Schwencke, Business Psychologist, Test Partnership

 

What Are Your Long-term Career Goals?

As an HR professional with years of experience, I believe that the best question to ask in a final interview is: “What are your long-term career goals, and how do you see this role contributing to them?”

This question allows the candidate to showcase their ambition and vision for their career, while also showing how they see themselves fitting into the organization and the role they are applying for. It also gives insight into the candidate’s level of commitment and dedication to their career and the company, which is important for long-term success.

This question can help the interviewer assess whether the candidate’s career goals align with the organization’s mission and vision, and whether they clearly understand how the role fits into the bigger picture. Overall, this question can provide valuable information for making a hiring decision and can help ensure a good fit for both the candidate and the organization.

Ben Basic, CMO, Get It Cleaned

 

Name Some Self-development Habits Which Help in This Role

Before making the final decision, it is important to assess if the candidate not only has the right work experience and skill set but also comes with an aligned mindset. Asking them about their habits will provide the interviewer with a holistic understanding of the candidate’s personality. 

We, as professionals, are well aware of how positive habits lead to efficient work management and ensure that most of our time at work is spent productively. This question will give the interviewer a chance to have a candid conversation and understand the candidate better to come to an informed decision. 

As an interviewee, when answering this question, talk about the habits that are most relevant to the job on offer. Also, do not forget to share a relevant example of how this habit helped you excel.

Tanisha Guin, Deputy Manager, Social Impact Consultant, and Career Coach, ICICI Foundation

How Do You View Success?

The best question to ask in a final interview is one that gives insight into how the individual thinks about their career and the company. A common example of this would be asking what motivates them professionally, as it speaks volumes about their willingness to take initiative and how they view success from a macro perspective. 

This type of question allows hiring managers to measure self-motivated candidates who are driven by intangible goals such as developing their skill set, utilizing personal strengths, and seeing their hard work pay off.

Julia Kelly, Managing Partner, Rigits

 

What is Your Company’s Competitive Edge?

I chose the question “What sets the company apart from its competitors, and how do you ensure that the company stays competitive?” as the best question to ask in a final interview because it shows that the candidate is interested in understanding the company’s unique selling proposition, and how they plan to maintain their competitive edge in the market. It also shows that the candidate is strategic and forward-thinking, as they are seeking information about the company’s long-term plans for success. 

When answering this question, it’s important to highlight specific aspects of the company’s products, services, or culture that set it apart from competitors, and provide examples of how the company has innovated to maintain its position in the market.

Ben Lau, Founder, Featured

 

Is This Enough Money for You to Walk Away from the Opportunity?

Place a check for $1,000.00 on the table, then ask, “Is this enough money for you to walk away from the opportunity? If it is, you are free to take it.”

If they take the money, they were not truly invested in accepting the role. If they ask for more money, they were not truly invested in the role and may job-hop in the near future.

If they immediately refuse the money, chances are they know you are testing them. As such, try additional questions to confirm their commitment to the role.

If they pause, think, and refuse the money, consider hiring them. Their reaction suggests that they will delay immediate gratification for long-term profit and they likely see themselves being successful at your company.

Amazon has a “Pay to Quit” program that pays employees to quit their jobs. Incentivizing people to walk away in the final stages of a job interview could work just as well and save headaches on the backend.

What Questions Do I Prepare for an Administrative Assistant Interview? | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/what-questions-do-i-prepare-for-an-administrative-assistant-interview/,"What Questions Do I Prepare for an Administrative Assistant Interview?

From asking about specific automated tasks to discovering high-stress day strategies, here are nine answers to the question, “What are the most effective interview questions for an administrative assistant, either virtual or in-person?”

 

Which Administrative Tasks Would You Want to Automate?
What is Your Email Inbox Strategy?
How Do You Maintain Confidentiality and Data Privacy?
What is a Time Management Technique You Abide By?
What is the Most Difficult Aspect of Your Position?
What is Your Approach to Learning New IT Systems?
How Would You Prioritize Conflicting Deadlines?
What Are Your Preferred Tools and Platforms?
Describe When You Had a High Workload and How You Coped

 

Which Administrative Tasks Would You Want to Automate?

Knowing whether a candidate is adept at identifying ways to automate tasks is vital for ensuring their productivity and keeping them for the long term. While there are certain aspects of every job that are just plain boring, administrative tasks are tedious and repetitive, leading to high turnover rates. 

And when an applicant shows an eagerness to streamline the day-to-day, it shows they’re looking to do more than answer the phones and schedule meetings. It shows which aspects of the job they enjoy the most and how they would like to shape the role going forward.

Shaunak Amin, CEO and Co-Founder, SwagMagic

 

What is Your Email Inbox Strategy?

Ask an administrative assistant what their strategy is for email inboxes. You want to ensure that the new hire is organized, especially for your inbox. How do they sort emails and follow up in a timely manner? If they don’t have a strategy, they may not be a fit for the role and you should evaluate other candidates.

Ann McFerran, CEO, Glamnetic

 

How Do You Maintain Confidentiality and Data Privacy?

As an administrative assistant, it is important to ensure the confidentiality and data privacy of an organization. A great interview question to assess how well a candidate understands the importance of this is “How do you ensure you maintain confidentiality and data privacy in your work as an administrative assistant?” 

This question gives the interviewer a better idea of how well the candidate knows the rules and procedures that must be followed when handling confidential information. Also, it gives them a chance to see how well the candidate can follow these rules and procedures. 

This is especially important for virtual administrative assistants, since they will access and handle confidential data remotely. By asking this question, you can identify if the candidate can keep confidential information safe, regardless of the environment.

Shaun Connell, Founder, Writing Tips Institute

 

What is a Time Management Technique You Abide By?

Do you have a time management technique that you follow religiously? An administrative assistant’s role requires one to juggle various tasks covering diverse thematic functions. By asking this question, the interviewer will know how efficiently the candidate manages their time and if there is too much supervision needed. 

When answering this question, you need not stick to just the popular techniques. Share a custom-made technique that has worked or works for you. This will make you come across as someone who is creative, authentic, and takes initiative. Ensure you answer the question in detail and provide an example explaining the “before and after” of using the technique.

Tanisha Guin, Deputy Manager, Social Impact Consultant, and Career Coach, ICICI Foundation for Inclusive Growth

 

What is the Most Difficult Aspect of Your Position?

What do you consider to be the most difficult aspect of the administrative assistant position? One technique for finding out a candidate’s weaknesses is to ask them this question. How the candidate responds to this question can reveal whether they can identify and develop their areas for growth. 

If the participant can comment on the issue they expect to encounter in their response to this question, the interviewer can mention a particular situation that they found difficult and explain what they did to get through that difficulty and achieve success. The interviewer gets to observe whether the candidate can continue to perform in tough conditions.

Georgi Todorov, Founder, ThriveMyWay

 

What is Your Approach to Learning New IT Systems?

Increasingly, administrative assistants are required to become adept at myriad IT systems and software packages. Each organization maintains a unique software stack, and not every candidate will be well-versed in your company’s chosen IT providers. 

Rather than holding out for candidates who already have expertise in your company’s software stack, look for candidates who can get up to speed quickly. By asking candidates how they adapt to new IT systems and software packages, you can explore their approach to learning, a far more powerful skill. 

This question is essential even for candidates who are accustomed to your company’s IT systems, as often organizations change providers and staff are required to re-learn these processes. Last, a sound answer to this question will highlight a commitment to lifelong learning, an essential mindset for anyone looking to build a successful career.

Ben Schwencke, Business Psychologist, Test Partnership

 

How Would You Prioritize Conflicting Deadlines?

As an attorney, having an administrative assistant is helpful for managing multiple tasks at once. Asking this question can help determine if a candidate can manage their resources to effectively complete multiple tasks in a timely manner. It also provides insight into the candidate’s organizational skills, which is key for any administrative assistant role. 

Leo Vaisburg, Managing Partner, Amazon Suspension Lawyer

 

What Are Your Preferred Tools and Platforms?

This question allows candidates to show off their mastery of various tools and platforms they are familiar with. To the interviewer, the answer provides firsthand information about the candidate’s skills. 

Tech tools and platforms are integral to an administrative assistant’s portfolio. Whether communication tools help them coordinate with teams and clients or collaboration tools make their job easier, an experienced assistant will have a long list. 

After all, every client and company has their own preferred tools, enabling assistants to master a variety of platforms. More importantly, the answer to this question will help you learn more about the on-the-job expertise the candidate has gained and if this expertise matches your requirements.

Ariav Cohen, VP of Marketing and Sales, Proprep

 

Describe When You Had a High Workload and How You Coped

Working as an administrative assistant, virtual or in-person, may ‌require the ability to manage and prioritize a high workload independently. By asking a candidate for a specific example of when they have had to manage a high workload and what strategies they used to cope, the interviewer can determine two things: 

What does the candidate actually classify as a high workload
Do they have strategies and methods that involve planning, prioritizing work, and using tools and technology to manage their workload? 

I recommend always asking a behavioral interview question that demands an evidence-based response rather than asking a generic or scenario-based question.

Do You Have Experience Working With a Scrum Framework?

In my experience as an interviewer for product owners, I always find one question particularly telling: “Do you have experience working with a Scrum framework?” As Agile methodology and Scrum become increasingly popular in working environments, being able to work within the Scrum framework is essential for being an effective product owner. 

The answer to this question can provide insight into both their technical aptitude and focus on results: people with a background in Scrum are well-organized, relentless goal-setters capable of foreseeing potential outcomes. Of course, there are other questions that can help determine if the candidate is suited to be a product owner, but this one is definitely one of the most important.

Antreas Koutis, Administrative Manager, Financer

 

What Is Important About Research and Validation?

As a product owner myself, I like to ensure that my team members clearly understand the importance of research and validation. One question I like to ask is, “What is the most important thing to remember about research and validation?” This question pushes the candidate to reflect on their own experience and gives me insight into their experience in a role that I value highly.

Matthew Ramirez, CEO, Rephrasely

 

How Do You Measure the Success of Your Product…?

When interviewing a product owner, one question I always ask is, “How do you measure the success of your product, and what metrics do you use?” 

This question allows you to understand their product management approach and gives insight into how they measure success. It helps you evaluate if they have the knowledge and experience to be a good fit for your company and gives you insight into whether they are using the right KPIs, as well as their ability to analyze and interpret the data. 

If possible, I like to get specific answers from candidates on what metrics they use, how often they track these metrics, and what actions they take based on them. If a candidate can’t provide specifics about their process, then this is a red flag that something may be wrong with their product management approach.

Shaun Connell, Founder, Writing Tips Institute

 

Who Is the Most Significant Product Stakeholder?

In an interview with a potential product owner, it is important to ask questions to assess their understanding of the role and ability to manage complex projects. One effective question that can help evaluate the candidate’s product management capacity is, “Who do you believe is the most significant product stakeholder‌?” 

This question will provide insight into how the prospective product owner perceives stakeholders and their involvement in product development. Not only will this answer provide valuable information about their technical and managerial skills, but it can also reveal key traits, such as adaptability and resourcefulness in managing different stakeholders.

Jim Campbell, Owner, Camp Media

 

How Do You Prioritize Product Backlog?

One of the major challenges of every product owner is backlog prioritization. Customer, stakeholder, and team feature requests, as well as various bugs, can pile up quickly. Having a clear picture of the situation and the ability to prioritize accordingly is a key responsibility of a good product owner. 

A great product owner can show that they have complete control over the backlog, as well as the confidence to make hard decisions and say no to stakeholders when needed. They should also be able to choose or change how they track the product backlog to ensure the maximum productivity of their team.

Gordana Sretenovic, Co-Founder, Workello

 

How Do You Stay Up-to-Date on Industry Trends and…

“How do you stay up-to-date on industry trends and market changes, and how do you incorporate this knowledge into your product strategy?” Since staying informed about industry trends and market changes is crucial for success as a product owner, this question is worth asking during the interview. 

By understanding how a candidate stays updated and incorporates this knowledge into their strategy, you can gauge their ability to keep the product relevant and competitive in a rapidly changing market. 

This question also sheds light on how the person approaches market research and their capacity for compiling and analyzing data. It shows their ability to recognize and address market opportunities and difficulties, which are crucial components of the product owner’s job. By asking it, you test a candidate’s ability to stay ahead of the curve and make accurate decisions that drive the product’s success.

Nina Paczka, Community Manager, Resume Now

 

How Can You Avoid Being a Bottleneck for a Scrum Team?

I would ask: “As a product owner, how can you avoid being a bottleneck for a Scrum team?”

This question reveals a candidate’s ability to prioritize and focus on activities with the greatest impact on the product’s success, effectively manage their backlog, communicate with the team, foster a shared vision among team members, decide promptly, and understand how to handle dependencies.

Maryna Kucherova, Head of Product and Advisor, Elai.io

 

What Do You Think About Our Current Product?

There are many outstanding questions to ask during an interview. However, I believe this is the most important one: “What do you think about our current product? Why?”

It will have you find out if they even checked it out, did their research, and how they feel about it. If they have not checked out your product, that would be a no-go for me. It will give you great insights into their thoughts and where you could improve if they did. 

It makes the question relevant to your product, dives into the willingness of the person wanting the job, and gives insight into what kind of value they can bring. You can dive deeper with questions like:

 Can you explain our target market and user needs for our current product?
 How would you measure the success of our product and track its performance over time? 

If you keep things relevant to your product, it might give you some new insights. Especially when you do more interviews, it will provide you with new ideas.

Joran Hofman, Founder, Reditus

 

How Do You Balance Trade-offs Between Key Stakeholders?

“Can you describe a time when you had to make a difficult trade-off between the needs of different stakeholders in a product development project, and how you resolved the situation?” 

This question can reveal the candidate’s problem-solving skills, decision-making ability, and experience in managing stakeholder expectations, which are all important qualities for a product owner. 

A good product owner needs to balance the interests of various stakeholders, such as customers, management, development teams, and business partners, to ensure that the product meets the needs of the target market while staying within the constraints of the project. 

By sharing a specific example, the candidate can show their ability to handle complex situations, communicate effectively, and find creative solutions to overcome obstacles.

Luciano Colos, Founder and CEO, PitchGrade

 

Can You Define the Product Owner Role?

How an applicant answers this question will say a lot about their knowledge and exposure to the interviewer. Product owners are primarily responsible for the maximization of the value of their product, so that should be a significant factor in their answer. They also prioritize and organize the team’s work, backlog, and act as a proxy for customers.

Alexandre Robicquet, Co-Founder and CEO, Crossing Minds

 

Describe a Challenge You’ve Had With an Executive 

A significant question to ask a product owner in an interview is, “Describe a challenge you’ve had with an executive and how did you overcome the problem?” 

This allows the candidate to think about their experience and the challenges they have faced in their past roles, which can give the interviewer a better idea of how the candidate will handle similar challenges if hired. 

Additionally, it can also reveal how creative and resourceful the candidate is in working through problems, especially with senior leadership in the organization.

Project Manager

One cannot overstate the value of a great project manager. A job in project management is a crash education in risk management, stress tolerance, and diplomacy, from detecting and removing bottlenecks to guaranteeing the flow of communication in cross-functional teams. New graduates seeking the freedom of working from any location should take note of these dynamic roles, which may frequently be performed remotely. It may be necessary for you to begin as an assistant before spending a few years working on your Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. The flexibility and career potential of these in-demand positions, however, may be astounding if you get past the initial obstacles. As an added benefit, you get to interact with a wide range of individuals, increasing your visibility and creating a top-notch professional network.

Social Media Manager

A lot of college graduates are opting in for the social media management niche and it is no surprise. Social media management comes easy to a lot of graduates because most of them are familiar with the internet, and a lot of businesses are going online to market their business. In addition, the learning curve for social media management is low when compared to other careers. Besides, there are a lot of detailed courses on social media management that college graduates can take to become familiar with the niche.

Simon Bacher, Simya Solutions

 

Accountant

Accountant. This career path is popular among college graduates from various fields of study. A degree in accounting is not a must. Still, becoming a Certified Public Accountant makes you a good candidate for the job in question. The head for numbers and being detail-oriented are also very much welcome. Accountants’ responsibilities include keeping track of a company’s records, making critical financial decisions, conducting financial audits, and more. They earn approximately $77,250 a year.

Agata Szczepanek, Resume Now

Businesses in today’s high-tech environment are always on the lookout for skilled software engineers who can help them succeed in the online world. Over the next decade, the demand for software developers is predicted to increase by at least 22 percent. There is an immediate need for recent college grads to boost the region’s technology sector’s talent pool.

Steve Pogson, FirstPier

 

User Experience Designer

More and more people are choosing to become UX/UI designers after college. UX designers don’t require coding experience but rather focus on advocating for the user and creating the experience of interacting with a software or technology. It is a very rewarding and lucrative career with massive potential for growth now and in the future.

Michael Burghoffer, PicoSolutions

 

Market Research Analyst

As a STEM student looking for a money-earning career, market research is the bull’s eye. Along with the fast-growing businesses like IT, the field is a vast ground of opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds like Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, Sociology, etc. Online certification courses for market research related to your study can help to enhance your skill set. Along with that, a knowledge of business and communication skills are keys to winning a profitable job in the field. A college student can prepare for the profile by seeking companies doing similar work and understanding their workflow. To shine bright on the horizon, industry insights can be helpful. The career is a smart choice as an average annual salary can reach up to $65000 or more. Therefore refresh your speaking and computer skills to land a job in the profile.

Alexander Reid, TriviaWhizz

 

Marketing Manager

The most popular job for college graduates is marketing manager. This is a good career choice for someone who likes to plan, organize and implement a marketing strategy. The average salary for this position is $106,000 per year. The top industries for this profession are healthcare and pharmaceuticals, financial services and insurance providers, and manufacturing companies. Marketing managers typically have a bachelor’s degree in marketing or business administration. They also must have at least three years of work experience in marketing before they can qualify for the PMP certification through Project Management Institute (PMI). This certification is required by many employers as a way to verify that their employees have the knowledge necessary to succeed in their roles as marketers.

Amer Hasovic, Love & Lavender

 

Teaching

Some states enable college grads with any bachelor’s degree to teach provisionally while they get their license, making elementary and kindergarten teaching a popular choice for fresh grads. A career in education may be both a stepping stone and a rewarding destination for those who enjoy working with young people.

Billy Parker, Gift Delivery

 

Software Developer

According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, the most popular job for college graduates is a software developer. I agree with this because most of my friends are pursuing computer science degrees. There is also a lot of demand for software engineers in the job market with no sign of slowing down!

Tyler Hull, Modern Exterior

 

Administrative Assistant

A popular job for college graduates to get their foot in the door could be an Administrative Assistant.  This allows college graduates to get some experience to list on their resumes and if they want to continue working for that same company, a great start to climing up the career ladder at that company.

Typically, Administrative Assistants are the face of the company as they are the first person that you interact with.  This allows for the Administrative Assistant to make connections with other employees at the company and to decide if the company would be a good fit for them to continue their career.

Lindsey Hight, Sporting Smiles

 

Travel Consultant

It’s safe to say that the newer generations value work-life balance and frequent travel a lot more, which is why many of them are slowly turning their attention to the travel and tourism industry. By interning at a travel agency, college graduates can pick up all the necessary skills needed to become a freelance travel consultant and understand where their interests lie. After this, they can follow it up with a diploma in their niche of preference and work remotely or anywhere in the world.

Guy Sharp, Andorra Guides

 

Sales

What types of jobs are popular for college graduates depends on the field of study. However, a common job for business students is a sales position. The pay is usually pretty good, and the required experience is minimal. It’s an attractive job for recent young graduates because it has performance pay and requires motivation.

Jordan Woolf, We Buy Houses in Bama

 

Tech Industry Jobs

One of the most popular jobs for college graduates is in the tech industry. As technological innovation continues to grow and expand, more and more jobs are opening up without the need for experience. Skills like digital and content marketing can be taught or achieved with an online certification. This is opening up a ton of opportunities for graduates who may have a degree in another industry, but would like to apply their skills in tech.

8 Tips for Comparing Two Job Offers | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/comparing-two-job-offers/,"What is one tip for a candidate that is comparing two job offers?



To help you best compare and choose between two job offers, we asked career coaches, recruiters and hiring managers this question for their best tips. From understanding the growth potential of each offer to building a comparison chart with pros and cons, there are several tips that would aid candidates in deciding which job is better among any two they are offered.

Here are eight tips these leaders offer candidates for comparing two job offers:

Understand the Growth Potential of Each Offer
Picture Yourself in Both Roles When Comparing Offers
Review Learning Opportunities
Always Take the Offer With the Best Leader
Consider Scheduling Flexibility
Ask Yourself if the Workplace Culture Suits You
Choose the One that Matches Your Values
Build a Comparison Chart With Pros and Cons

 

Understand the Growth Potential of Each Offer

Aside from picking the team/manager that you get along best with, select the company that is invested in employee growth and offers a clear path for progression. That’s where the best long-term fit will be and where you know your career goals will be nurtured. Find out what the performance management and promotion process is, as well as what kind of learning and development opportunities will be available to you.

Sam Basu Farreca, Culture Strategy

Picture Yourself in Both Roles When Comparing Offers

Using your intuition (based on past experiences) is a great way to make the difficult choice between two jobs. Mentally and visually picture yourself in each position and think about what your average day would look like within each role. From the start of the workday until the end of the workday, consider which job gets you more excited and why the other job seems less interesting. Base your visualization on your impression of the company, your new coworkers, and the job responsibilities to decide which role comes out the victor.

Ronald Kubitz, Forms+Surfaces

Review Learning Opportunities

Some companies out there are well-known for the learning opportunities they provide. And even when a candidate has another offer that seems better at first glance, the far better choice would be heading to the organization that associates itself with learning. As individuals navigate their career path, they realize that the stints that taught them enough to make that next big jump were far better than the ones that paid them well or even offered them better positions. After all, in the long term, or even when you consider the later stages of your career, it is what you know about an industry and job profile that matters more than your remuneration or position.

Riley Beam, Douglas R. Beam, P.A.

 

Always Take the Offer With the Best Leader

The offer working for the best leader is generally the offer to accept, assuming that the two offers are generally similar in comp and benefits. A good leader will spend the energy and time helping you get off to a good start. They will support and help you grow in the company, leading to promotions and an increase in compensation. Ask to speak with some of the employees who report to the leader and ask about the leader’s style. Also ask the leader for examples of employees that they have hired and how they have developed them and helped them be successful.

Scott Baker, Stage 3 Leadership

 

Consider Scheduling Flexibility

If you’re trying to decide which is the better option between two job choices, be sure to keep scheduling flexibility in mind. After the pandemic, many employees found it difficult to go back to a traditional 9-to-5 environment. However, a lot of companies are now offering either hybrid or strictly remote working models, along with more time off with reimbursement. Decide which environment suits you the best, and then make that your tie-breaker in these situations.

Mark Sider, Greater Than

 

Ask Yourself if the Workplace Culture Suits You

Before you make a decision, look into the workplace culture of both companies to decide which one suits you best. If you’re someone who is more laidback and autonomous, a culture that promotes the ‘hustle’ or has a fast-paced environment may challenge you in the short-run but drain you as time goes by. Thus, evaluating a company’s culture is a crucial aspect of deciding which job opportunity to pursue.

Marc Roca, 4WD Life

 

Choose the One that Matches Your Values

There are undoubtedly myriad job opportunities that may cross your path during your professional tenure. However, it’s crucial to find ones that you enjoy and that contribute to your growth in the long term. One way to identify the right opportunity is by looking into the company’s values and evaluating if they align with yours. If the values do match, you’re more likely to have a seamless experience and minimize any unnecessary friction.

Benoit Lacroix, Portmoni

 

Build a Comparison Chart With Pros and Cons

Research and build a comparison chart that also has the pros and cons of each offer. By visually seeing what each has to offer, one can better determine which offer suits the needs of the candidate’s situation. Sections within the chart that are helpful other than pay and benefits are the work environment and coworkers, as well as if the company culture aligns with the candidate’s personal values.

11 Tips for Responding to a Lowball Job Offer | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/11-tips-for-responding-to-a-lowball-job-offer/,"How should you respond to a lowball job offer?


To help you best respond to a lowball job offer, we asked hiring managers and experienced recruiters this question for their best advice. From responding with the right questions to negotiating for a performance review, there are several tips that would help you choose your response appropriately to make the best out of the situation.



Here are 11 tips these leaders would follow in responding to a low job offer:
Respond With the Right Questions
Negotiate for Other Benefits
Be Gracious and Probe if Anything Could Improve or Not
Don’t Take It Personally
Be Collaborative and Not Confrontational
Find Out When Salary Could Increase
Thank Them and Ask for Time to Consider it
Ask if the Offer is Negotiable
Consider Long-Term and Work Backward
Tip for a Low-ball Job Offer
Negotiate for a Performance Review

 

Respond With the Right Questions

A lowball job offer doesn’t necessarily have to be the end of the road. Instead, treat it like the start of the negotiation phase and line up questions that could work in your favor. Begin with questions on if you were specifically being offered a lower than usual package or if this was more in line with the company’s remuneration policy. Find out if you fall short in any way and if responding with the requisite information would make a difference. You can even ask for details on associated perks and benefits that may justify a lower core salary. Depending on the answers you receive, you can make an informed decision or learn some essential insights for a more convincing round of negotiations.

Riley Beam, Douglas R. Beam, P.A.

 

Negotiate for Other Benefits

Negotiate for other benefits. It’s important to determine early on whether the offer is low because that’s all the company can afford to pay or if it’s an intentional lowball. If it’s the latter, it’s worth taking some time to think about if you want to join a company that doesn’t want to invest in you. But if it’s the former, and especially if it’s a job you really want, you should try to negotiate additional benefits in lieu of pay. Extra vacation time, flexible hours or work-from-home options are all cost-effective for the business and can make up some of the gap in cash compensation.

Lisa Odenweller, Kroma Wellness

Be Gracious and Probe if Anything Could Improve or Not

You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. When presented with a lowball offer, being gracious is your best bet to getting what you want. For example, politely explain that while you are interested in the position and feel passionate about the company, their offer isn’t plausible for your lifestyle and/or living expenses. Thank them for the opportunity and either ask if there is room for negotiation or come right out with a counter-offer. This will show that you know your worth and if they do have the capacity for upping the offer, they will.

Matt Woods, SOLD.com

 

Don’t Take It Personally

My biggest tip for any candidate that has received a lowball offer is to not take it personally. There can be many reasons why the employer offered the salary they did. Part of the reason could be their budget, or maybe they are expecting you to negotiate with them. However, when you get a lowball offer it never has to do with you personally. However, if you’re not happy with the offer, and you’re not willing to negotiate, just stay calm, and thank them for their time. Never accept anything less than you’re worth.

Rich Rudzinski, Tragic Media

 

Be Collaborative and Not Confrontational

Believe it or not, companies want talent at the best possible price. One thing that should remain consistent across the entire hiring process is that you should remain pleasant. HR and employers want to pay candidates they like and would enjoy working with. If you are confrontational or rude they will wonder what it would be like to work with someone who is combative. When you receive a lowball offer, negotiate, collaboratively. Consider these factors when preparing your counter-offer: Your Qualifications, Skill Level, Work Ethic, offers from other companies, and the Market Average. 

Then, approach with collaboration. For example, “I’m very happy to have received an offer! This opportunity sounds like a great fit and based on our conversations I know I would be an excellent addition to the team. But, based on my experience I’m targeting a base pay of X, how close can we get to that?” If they refuse to change the salary, politely remove yourself from contention, and move on!

Dan Reed, Top Prospect Careers

Find Out When Salary Could Increase

Ask if there is much room for growth and advancement at the company. Perhaps they are offering a lower salary to be safe and not make too big of an investment before getting to know you better. However, if you can prove how skilled and efficient you are, they may increase your salary in the coming months. Find out if this is possible. In that case, you could make the decision to give this job a chance.

Drew Sherman, Carvaygo

 

Thank Them and Ask for Time to Consider it

Don’t respond emotionally or take it personally. Instead, thank them for the offer and ask for time to consider it. They may respond with a better offer. If not, this gives you time to consider what might be acceptable to you in regards to negotiation, perhaps better benefits to compensate for the low salary? Just know that there are a myriad of reasons why you may receive a lowball offer, having nothing to do with your worth and this may only be the beginning of the conversation.

Erin Banta, Pepper

 

Ask if the Offer is Negotiable

If an offer is made that you believe should be higher or offer a better total compensation package, ask the employer these four magic words, “Is this offer negotiable?” Oftentimes employers have a salary range, bonuses, and/or benefits that they have available to negotiate. Make sure you have the minimum salary, bonus, and benefits in mind before asking the magic question. Not sure what those numbers are or should be? Do some research before having the discussion. You can find tons of information regarding compensation ranges in your field, industry, level, and location online, such as Glassdoor, Salary.com, Indeed, and Payscale.

Lucie Yeomans, Your Career Ally

 

Consider Long-Term and Work Backward

Consider the long-term. What a great position to be in, but it does require some deep thinking. When you’re choosing between two job offers, think about where you want to be in your career in 7 years and which of these two jobs will get you there (or get you closest). Think about each job and be as honest as you can with yourself. What are the perks? What are the downfalls? What aspects you’re surprised you like? Who are the team members you connect with the most? Write it all down and then assess. The best way to make the right choice here is to set your end goal and work backward.

Karim Hachem, Sunshine79

 

Remain Polite While You Make a Decision

Suppose you are in an interview, and you get a meager offer. The first thing you should do is say thank you because you want to remain polite, but then follow up with either that you’ll go away and think about it, or you can then explain you know your worth and that the offer given does not match the expertise you can provide and proceed to try and negotiate a better deal.

Or another quick tip would be not to be afraid to walk away from a lousy offer; you are not being unfair or unappreciative, and finding a career that will pay you what you are worth is more important than anything else.

Wendy Makinson, Joloda Hydraroll

 

Negotiate for a Performance Review

When one gets into a new job, the employers may be skeptical about their skills – hence the tendency to give low salaries. The employee in question may negotiate for a performance review after a set period of time, so that the company can eventually place them in a better position to get the salary they deserve after their competency has been tested. The review may come in the form of a promotion or some incentives, bonuses, or salary increment.

10 Best Practices for Interviewing as a Recent Graduate | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/best-practices-for-interviewing-as-a-recent-graduate/,"What is one best practice when heading into an interview as a recent college graduate? 

To help recent college graduates prepare for job interviews, we asked career coaches and HR leaders this question for their best advice. From being clear and intentional to demonstrating a willingness to work and learn, there are several best practices that may help you feel more prepared and confident going into an interview as a recent graduate.

Here are 10 best practices for interviewing as a recent graduate:
Be Clear and Intentional
Avoid Being Too Casual With The Interviewer
Do Your Research
Know How To Present Your Background and Experience
Play Up Your Soft Skills
Take Time to Understand the Job
Emphasize Skills and Lessons Learned in College
Prepare Alternative Answers for Work Experience Questions
Bring a Pen and Paper
Demonstrate a Willingness To Work and Learn

 

 

Be Clear and Intentional

Many college students will interview without a lot of clarity around what they want. This may come across as “I’m still trying to figure it out” or “I just want a job that gives me the ability to travel.” Instead, be intentional about what you are working towards. Have a clear narrative for why you’re applying for that role or company. You don’t have to make a lifelong decision, but interviewing with an intentional purpose will help you stand out from other recent graduates.

Logan Mallory, Motivosity

 

Avoid Being Too Casual With The Interviewer

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve interviewed a recent college graduate, established some good rapport, and been referred to as “bro” or “dude” in the interview. I’m not your “bro,” and don’t call me “dude” in an interview. I’m your interviewer and prospective employer. If a candidate wants a position at a company, maintain a level of professionalism while still being true to who you are.

Brett Farmiloe, Terkel

 

Do Your Research

Do some research and learn about trends in their industry, as well as who your interviewer is, the history of the company, and their mission. What goals, accomplishments, awards, and or distinctions have set them apart as leaders in their field? Understanding who is looking to hire you and knowing what they are all about can make a big difference in setting you apart from other candidates, during the interview. Discover what they are looking for in terms of particular qualities or experience, and then prepare yourself accordingly to become as attractive and qualified a candidate as possible!

Lastly, remember that the interview is not just about them getting to know you, but about YOU getting to know them! Do your goals align with theirs? Is this a place where you could see yourself growing and being happy? When you focus on the interview being as much for you as it is for them, it makes the experience much less nerve-wracking.

Linda Scorzo, Hiring Indicators

 

Know How To Present Your Background and Experience

You should be able to talk through your accomplishments and challenges from each role on your resume. This means having specific examples and a story to tell. When you have your stories already thought out, you’ll be ready for any of those common “tell me about a time when…” questions. You can also add those examples to any other type of question you’re asked. It’s okay if you can’t quickly recall every experience, that’s where your preparation comes in. Take some time in the days before the interview to recall (and even write out) your experiences ahead of time so they are easy to remember on the day of the interview.

Marisa Allen, University of Arizona, Eller College of Management

 

Play Up Your Soft Skills

As a recent college graduate, it’s likely you don’t have a ton of experience in your field. However, there are soft skills, like communication, leadership and adaptability that are valuable no matter what your job is. Once you identify your best soft skills, be prepared to show (and not just tell) how you use them. Is there a time when you made a real difference during an internship, as part of a college organization or in life in general? Offer real-life examples that play up those soft skills and what you’re capable of.

Take Time to Understand the Job

As a new college graduate, entering into an interview can be scary because of all the unknowns. You have so many questions prior to the interview and afterward. The key is to prepare weeks in advance. Look up the company’s core values, write out the questions you want to ask at the end of the interview, and make note of your strengths and weaknesses. Lastly, understand the duties and responsibilities within the job description and make note of how your previous experience can contribute to the new role.

TK Morgan, Tuesday at 1030

 

Emphasize Skills and Lessons Learned in College

As a recent graduate, highlighting the skills gained and lessons learned in college can be very beneficial. Not only do you show the organization that you really applied yourself, but it also shows that you retained useful information. Highlighting your unique journey and skillset also sets you apart from the other candidates.

Hilary Kozak, LivSmooth

 

Prepare Alternative Answers for Work Experience Questions

There are often questions in an interview about past workplace experiences, asking you to describe past customer/coworker interactions or your response to common workplace scenarios. These can trip up recent college grads who don’t have much (or any) work experience to draw from. You can prepare for this by looking up the most common hypothetical or situational interview questions and brainstorming some similar scenarios you’ve experienced in an internship, school club, classroom, volunteer activity, etc.

You never want to respond with “I’ve never had that experience” when it comes to questions about soft skills like leadership, communication, and teamwork, or about your greatest strengths, weaknesses, accomplishments, or mistakes. Knowing in advance what you’ll answer to these common questions can help prevent your lack of workplace experience from being an impediment to getting hired.

Archie Payne, Caltek Staffing

 

Bring a Pen and Paper

Bring a pen and paper to take notes during an interview. This is a great way to retain the knowledge of all of the information the company shares, which may include day-to-day tasks, salary, or hierarchy within the company. To the manager, it shows you’re engaged and interested in the position. First impressions are everything, and this small tip will ensure your interaction is a positive one.

Sara Adam Slywka, Nestig

 

Demonstrate a Willingness To Work and Learn

The best practice when heading into an interview as a recent college graduate is to show you are willing to work and learn. We already know that it’s hard to find a first job that we love, but if you show them that you are willing to work and learn more, it’s easier.

Show them that you are organized, committed, and responsible and that you think it’s better to learn by doing, and trying. Go to the interview a little earlier, maybe 10 to 15 minutes, with a smile on your face. I was an HR leader for a long time at a small company. We hired some recent college graduates at the time, and the ones who stayed with us were the most energetic and committed.

I know it’s not easy, but, if you do this, they will be more inclined to hire you, and they will be happy to have someone with such a willingness to work.

12 Skills to Master Before Applying to Entry-Level Jobs | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/12-skills-to-master-before-applying-to-entry-level-jobs/,"What is one skill to master before applying for entry level jobs?


To help you master the necessary skills to land an entry level job, we asked CEOs and small business owners this question for their best insights. From learning how to write to developing an attention to detail, there are several recommendations that may help you prepare to apply for entry level jobs. 

Here are 12 skills to master before applying to entry-level jobs:



Learn How to Write
Write an Effective Resume
Master Your Elevator Pitch
Understand Basic Computer Programs
Be Comfortable With Research and Preparation 
Gain Leadership and Management Skills
Learn to Adapt Easily
Create Enticing Cover Letters 
Master Time Management
Work On Your Data-Gathering Skills
Be Able to Communicate Effectively 
Develop an Attention to Detail 

 

Learn How to Write

In order to be taken seriously for a position, you must first learn how to present yourself properly, and this is usually done by email. Written communication is the first thing a recruiter sees, and if you don’t have a competent grasp of writing, your application may find its way to the bottom of the pile. You don’t need to be Charles Dickens, but a candidate should have the ability to clearly communicate their thoughts with good grammar and proper spelling. These are basic things that point to a candidate’s general level of competency.

Bill Mann, Restore Privacy

 

Write an Effective Resume

One skill to master before applying for entry level jobs is how to write a clear and concise resume. By mastering this skill, applicants will be able to showcase their strengths and qualifications in a way that is easy for potential employers to understand. Additionally, those with a well-written resume are more likely to be called in for interviews.

Matthew Ramirez, Rephrase

 

Master Your Elevator Pitch

When you start applying for jobs, make sure to master your elevator pitch, or your 90 second introduction. Without fail the interviewer will ask some version of, “Tell me about yourself?” A polished and clear introduction creates a great first impression. Instead of rambling or oversharing, have a clear, concise overview of your experience and skills. It will start your interview off on the right foot and help you stand out from other applicants that don’t take the time to prepare.

Logan Mallory, Motivosity

 

Understand Basic Computer Programs

Those applying to entry level jobs should be able to perform clerical duties, or to at least have some skills that apply to these kinds of duties. For example, knowing the basics of MS Excel and MS Word (or Google Sheets and Google Docs) can definitely help. These are very common tools used for people in entry level positions to assist their managers.

Jared Hines, Acre Gold

 

Be Comfortable With Research and Preparation 

The art of research and preparation is crucial to master before applying for entry level jobs and is essential for successful interview experiences. Candidates must show employers that they are resourceful and trustworthy by coming to interviews prepared. One way to do this is to realize the interview process starts the day before. Prepare for the interview beforehand by researching the company, coming with good questions, and practice your responses to best align your experience and skills with the job description. This shows employers that you are detail-oriented and organized and could make or break your case for securing the job.

Michelle Arnau, Rowan

 

Gain Leadership and Management Skills

Graduates need to have leadership and management skills before entering the workforce. In many cases, entry-level workers will manage interns and serve as a mentor to them. They need to be able to give direction in an effective way to begin climbing the career ladder. To gain these skills, turn to managers that you admire and their work ethic. What are their day-to-day tasks and how do they manage their staff in a way that you admire? Replicate those qualities and make them your own.

Sara Adam Slywka, Nestig

 

Learn to Adapt Easily

The ability to adapt is imperative for anyone applying for entry level jobs. Things will constantly be changing, so being able to adapt to meet those changes head-on will make you much more successful. Remaining rigid and incapable of pivoting will set yourself up for failure.

Leo Livshetz, Unhide

 

Create Enticing Cover Letters

Any career counselor will tell you that a dazzling cover letter is one of the best ways to grab the attention of hiring managers. Learn to write a good one if you want to land an interview. Anyone who knows how to write an attention-grabbing first paragraph should take advantage of that skill when writing a cover letter. Then describe how well your skills, experience and interests fit with the open position. Flesh that out across a few paragraphs, but don’t meander. Then close with a convincing paragraph about what makes you an ideal selection. Hiring managers can glean a lot about a candidate based on the cover letter. Make it count.

Scott MacDonell, Bambee

 

Master Time Management

One of the most prevalent job criteria for entry-level workers is time management, particularly for occupations that require no experience. While the ability to efficiently manage time has always been important, the fast expansion of remote work has brought it to the forefront. Your boss now wants to know that you can organize your workplace, manage your time, and complete tasks without the continual supervision of a team lead.
Time management includes planning, punctuality, prioritizing activities, delegating, the ability to say no, and meeting deadlines. You must demonstrate that you can plan your time and stay proactive even while working remotely in today’s world of continual distractions.

Leslie Radka, GreatPeopleSearch

 

Work On Your Data-Gathering Skills

Irrespective of the job position, the company, and the industry, there is a high probability that today, even that entry-level position will need someone who knows at least a little bit about gathering data. Polishing your research skills is a surefire way to project yourself as a valid candidate. Moreover, with good data-gathering skills, you can also widen your job-hunting horizon and apply for positions that, despite being entry-level, also promise growth opportunities.

Danielle Bedford, Coople

 

Be Able to Communicate Effectively 

In almost any job you’ll need to communicate with someone – an external client, an internal team member, at the very least the person who interviews you. The main two components of communication are content and delivery. Content is what you say or the actual information you’re conveying. Delivery is how you say it. Paying attention to both of these components and working to master them is a great idea! It will serve you well in business and in life.

Quick tip on content: Identify the key information you want to convey. What is the most important thing for your listener to understand? Quick tip on delivery: Make sure you deliver this information in a way that is easy-to-understand for your listener. This could depend on different factors such as how much does your listener already know about this subject, what is relevant information vs. unnecessary information, are you delivering good news or bad news, what tone of voice would help your message “land” best.

Emily Sander, Next Level Coaching, LLC

 

Develop an Attention to Detail

One of the great skills one should master before applying for entry jobs is a great attention to details. Why this? Well, every content should match with the title, if you do not pay attention to every detail about what you are asked to write about, you will fail to impress your audience. Here are some tips: Stay focused, ask questions, don’t plan what to do while listening, and keep your mind open. Paying great attention to every detail will help you develop good content.

14 Tips for Recent Graduates Entering the New Hybrid Workforce | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/14-tips-for-recent-graduates-entering-the-new-hybrid-workforce/,"What is one tip for recent graduates entering this increasingly popular hybrid workforce?


To help you enter the hybrid workforce, we asked HR leaders and small business owners this question for their best advice. From flaunting remote working skills on your resume to asking interviewers about work environments, there are several tips that may help you break into the new hybrid workforce as a recent graduate.

Here are fourteen tips for recent graduates entering the new hybrid workforce:



Flaunt Remote Working Skills on Your Resume 
Consider the Lifestyle You Want
Make Connections
Police Yourself to Stay Focused
Stay Up-To-Date on Digital Work Tools 
Be Prepared to Work Harder to Earn Your Boss’s Trust
Find a Mentor
Apply to Jobs Regardless of Location 
Consider In-Person Positions 
Be Prepared to Learn
Read all Training Materials and Ask Questions 
Polish Your Writing Skills
Look for Teams that Collaborate Across Departments
Ask Interviewers About Work Environments

 

Flaunt Remote Working Skills on Your Resume 

My tip for recent graduates entering the hybrid workforce is to mention your remote work skills on your resume as well. I know you try to brag about the expertise you have achieved, projects you have completed, and rewards you have earned. But, don’t forget to mention your hybrid or distributed work expertise. How you can manage a remote team or work in a remote work environment and how you can maintain your productivity in the hybrid ecosystem are a few attributes to mention on the resume. The hybrid work model is going to stay here for long and you need to prove to your employer that you are comfortable and suitable to sustain in this kind of ecosystem.

Caroline Lee, CocoSign

 

Consider the Lifestyle You Want

Consider what kind of lifestyle you want, and whether you want to work in an office or at home. You could also consider whether you want to work some days in an office and some days at home. As you are applying to jobs, make sure to find more details about the work models of these jobs. Then you will be able to assess which jobs will work better with the lifestyle that you want.

Matt Miller, Embroker

 

Make Connections

One of the most important tips for graduates, or anyone, entering into the hybrid workplace is to make and maintain quality relationships at work. It is so easy to stay isolated in your own bubble when working from home, but challenge yourself to interact or work with one new person on your team each week. This is a great way to immerse yourself in the company culture, build relationships for the future, and show to your team how valuable you are as a teammate.

Joe Spector, Dutch

 

Police Yourself to Stay Focused

With people working from home, being able to police yourself and stay focused will be more and more important. It can be easy to get distracted while working from home, so staying aware of how often you are getting distracted will help you be a better employee in the long run. Eliminate things that can cause you to lose focus and decrease your productivity from your workspace. Keep your workspace organized so you can easily find what you need to get your work done.

Brett Sohns, LifeGoal Investments

 

Stay Up-To-Date on Digital Work Tools 

Since the pandemic began, there has been a huge demand for remote work software solutions. Learn about innovative digital work tools that you can incorporate into your virtual workspace to increase productivity. You’ll really come off as an experienced employee when you share your expertise with your team and managers. TheVerge.com is one of my favorite websites for staying up-to-date on the latest tech trends.

Stephanie Venn-Watson, fatty15

 

Be Prepared to Work Harder to Earn Your Boss’s Trust

Employers today are more accustomed to managing on-site teams, and many of those in charge of hybrid workplaces are new to handling remote staff. In such a situation, I’ve observed some skepticism among managers of WFH employees about their reliability, with some going as far as comparing remote work with paid vacation. While seasoned workers may have established a good relationship with their direct reports and working off-site might not be as problematic for them, I think recent grads will have to work harder to get their bosses to trust them. 

I strongly recommend that new employees at hybrid workplaces stay available online during work hours, be prompt in answering questions, and make an extra effort to participate in group discussions and meetings to reassure their managers about their activity. Similarly, trusting your employer, manager, and supervisor is equally important to stay engaged and productive in the long term.

Anjela Mangrum, Mangrum Career Solutions

 

Find a Mentor

Recent graduates should look for a mentor that can guide them to success. Some new hires may feel out of place and unsettled in a remote/hybrid work environment. This is especially true for entry-level workers as this may be their first job out of college. An employee that can show them the ropes of the company’s mission, values, and method of working will not only help them get acclimated but make them feel like a part of the team. Daily Zoom calls, as well as weekly in-person meetings, will be extremely beneficial in the beginning stages, and can then transition to every other week or monthly get-togethers. Everyone should feel included in the workplace – and a mentor can lead the way.

Sara Adam Slywka, Nestig

 

Apply to Jobs Regardless of Location 

Don’t let location deter you from applying for opportunities. Businesses are increasingly satisfied with hiring a remote employee, if that applicant shows great potential. With hybrid models increasingly becoming normalized, location is no longer the deterrent it once was for hiring. So don’t be shy when applying for positions–as long as you feel qualified and the position looks appealing, you should send in an application.

John Jacob, Hoist

 

Consider In-Person Positions 

Recent graduates should not assume that remote work is best for them. Those in-person, spur-of-the-moment conversations that happen in an office setting are almost impossible to replicate on Slack channels or Zoom meetings. Some companies, like ours, insist on employees being present whenever possible. College graduates should embrace such an opportunity because there is no better experience than being around experienced individuals with different points of view. In an office setting, you’re more engaged and more motivated, and you don’t miss critical conversations that happen when the camera isn’t on. You’ll wind up being a more effective worker in the office.

Scott MacDonell, Bambee

 

Be Prepared to Learn

The job market is changing and with it, the way we work. With so many new opportunities in the hybrid workforce, it’s important to be prepared to learn new things on the job. This means being open to new technologies and ways of working and being ready to hit the ground running on day one. In a hybrid workforce, you need to be proactive in order to get ahead, take every opportunity that comes your way, and use it as a learning experience. Keep an open mind and be willing to work hard and you’ll be successful in this new type of workforce.

Peter Lucas, Relocate to Andorra

 

Read all Training Materials and Ask Questions 

The best advice for recent graduates entering the remote workforce is to read everything relating to a new job from start to finish and ask questions when appropriate. A new handbook, training manual, etc. is one’s most important tool with remote work. Taking in as much information as possible about the role and supplementing it with questions when a meeting does occur ensures the best understanding of the new position. Curiosity from a new employee will never be frowned upon.

Loic Claveau, Prometeus Labs

 

Polish Your Writing Skills

Working in a hybrid environment means that you will certainly communicate with a part of your team solely online. This is why improving your written communication skills is essential. From writing formal emails to managing to convey your point clearly and concisely, it all makes a difference in communication where nonverbal cues are removed.

Georgi Todorov, thrivemyway

 

Look for Teams that Collaborate Across Departments

“Could you give some examples of how my role impacts other roles or departments on the team?” This interview question will help a recent graduate discover if different departments are working well with one another despite all of the recent changes. With hybrid work, many departments are siloed from each other, which can cause confusion or tension. It’s best to try to enter a role knowing that product, design, sales, marketing, etc. are all working fluidly. The applicant can also ask how team wide decisions are made, and how major changes are announced. These questions will also show the interviewer that you are invested in the company overall.

Carla Andre-Brown, Mailbird

 

Ask Interviewers About Work Environments

While hybrid work models have become more common these days, this is not to say that every company has mastered the art of managing a hybrid work environment. When you are interviewing for a job with a hybrid work model, ask the interviewer questions such as “What is the work environment like?” and “How much are remote employees included?” so that you can get a sense of what it would be like working at this company, whether in person or remotely.

"How to Avoid Being ""PigeonHoled"" In Your Career | InterviewFocus",https://interviewfocus.com/how-to-avoid-being-pigeonholed-in-your-career/,"What is one way to avoid being pigeonholed in your career?


To help you avoid being pigeonholed in your career, we asked CEOs and HR leaders this question for their best recommendations. From expanding your comfort zone to demonstrating your flexibility, there are several tips that may help you overcome career limitations in the future.

Here are eleven recommendations to avoid being pigeonholed in your career:



Expand Your Comfort Zone
Learn, Train and Be Transparent
Leave Your Job or Standardize Your Work 
Stop Saying “No” to Other Responsibilities
Be Proactive in Seeking Out New Opportunities
Pay Attention to New Tech Trends
Continue Your Education 
Add Value by Learning New Things About Your Industry
Follow the Leaders
Overhaul Your Image Strategically 
Demonstrate Your Flexibility 




 

Expand Your Comfort Zone

There is a fine line between promoting a brand and becoming branded. And while we all want to become the “go-to” person for a valuable skill, success rarely comes from being a one-trick-pony. The secret to not getting pigeonholed is to occasionally take on projects that are outside your comfort zone. Playing a supporting role, showcasing your ability to learn, and demonstrating a little vulnerability along the way can help others see you in a new light.  Don’t worry. Your expert status will remain intact. Your openness will simply let the powers that be know you’re open to next-level opportunities.

Tim Toterhi, Plotline Leadership

 

Learn, Train and Be Transparent

Always be learning. Technology is always changing as are the strategies that business leaders use to get results. It’s essential to continue learning within your industry or field so that you don’t get left behind.

Train for the job you want. Additionally, to avoid getting pigeonholed in a lower level position, think about where you want to advance. Pay attention to the work that is being done by your colleagues who are a few steps ahead of you in the advancement pipeline and learn the skills that are essential to their jobs.

Be transparent about your goals. Talk to your supervisor about your future goals. Let them know where you see yourself and how you’d like to advance in your career in the future. Being transparent about your ambition lets your supervisor know that you are interested in and don’t want to be passed over for future opportunities.

Anna Caldwell, Beyond Finance

 

Leave Your Job or Standardize Your Work 

I view a job as a temporary solution to a permanent problem. That problem is how you make a living. If you are pigeonholed at work or stuck in your current position for a variety of reasons (no room to advance, specialization, too valuable to promote, no viable replacement), there are a few options you can take. Option 1- leave the company. This is the most drastic, but I would advise setting up a transition time (2-3 months) in which you tell your company you want to leave, please find my replacement so you can train them and create a smooth transition. Option 2 – develop and standardize your work and the work of your peers. Develop a method and plan to manage your job and others that are similar. In this scenario, you are creating a position for yourself and can show management improvement, standardization, and benefits of creating the position.

Joseph Romani, Chewy

 

Stop Saying “No” to Other Responsibilities

This is an obvious one but one that is important to bear repeating. Throughout my career, I’ve noticed people who never took on any new responsibilities or volunteered to look into other facets of the business almost always lost out on opportunities to transition to a different field because they had no real experience to speak of.

Trendy Tan, QuickHR

 

Be Proactive in Seeking Out New Opportunities

Your professional identity is defined by actions and experiences, like the projects you take on or the certifications, skills, and accomplishments on your CV and resume. If these all focus on the same type of work, your colleagues and managers are going to think that’s all you do. You can change this by actively pursuing new skills and professional experiences. Look for projects you can take on in your current role that push you outside your usual niche or comfort zone, and ask your manager about opportunities for cross-training or reskilling that exist within the company.

Archie Payne, Caltek Staffing

 

Pay Attention to New Tech Trends

The best way to avoid being pigeonholed is to stay up to date on trends. As technology evolves, so do the skills that are in demand. If you find yourself being pigeonholed, explore the different avenues that technology opens up, that suit your unique talents and interests. This can be done through side projects or new initiatives.

Jonathan Baillie Strong, Spotlight Podcasting

 

Continue Your Education 

I used to be a developer before becoming a project manager, then an educator/business owner in the space. I believe continuous education is the secret to keep evolving in your career. When you educate yourself, you can take on more roles, wear more hats, etc. This lets you be more useful and naturally leads to career growth, new opportunities, and so on and so forth. I know this as someone who’s helped thousands of people get the education they need to advance their career!

Cornelius Fichtner, PM Exam Simulator

 

Add Value by Learning New Things About Your Industry

Employee stagnation, a concept I coined, is an organizational challenge that occurs when lower-level staff feel disconnected from the company, middle-management runs into delays that impede progress and organizational effectiveness, and the executive leadership has an inability to get rid of structure or human resource obstacles. We live in a time when we have access to a wealth of information at our fingertips. However, having access to information, acquiring knowledge, and applying the lessons in our personal or professional lives is another conversation. When we are willing to learn new things about our industry, respond swiftly to market trends, or discover innovative approaches that help our organizations move forward toward goal achievement, we avoid being pigeonholed in our careers. While certain members benefit more from strengthening and showcasing their skills set, all members of the organization must work together to shape and produce high-growth opportunities.

A. Margot Blair, AMB Consulting & Co.

 

Follow the Leaders

Use social media to follow leaders in other careers you admire, especially if you don’t know them! Window shop other people’s careers by following what they’re talking about, who their followers follow, etc. When you follow the right people, something will resonate with you and then it is time to engage. Comment, tell them you like what they posted or see things a bit differently. Make new friends.

Juan Kingsbury, Career Blindspot

 

Overhaul Your Image Strategically 

It’s your mission to overhaul your image strategically. To shift someone’s perception of you, it’s important that you must give them a reason to believe in you. Next, make sure you have the opportunity to demonstrate your learning capacity and potential. Put the focus on your willingness to try, your openness to learning, and your commitment to the team’s success. Lastly, show them that you have opinions, don’t be afraid to speak out because usually, we believe that always agreeing is good. However, once you let them know where you stand without them asking, you have earned their respect.

Tristan Harris, Thrive Agency

 

Demonstrate Your Flexibility

If the interests or skills appear to be limited, you are more likely to be pigeonholed at work. People begin to regard you as someone who can be moved around easily when you demonstrate your capacity and desire to flex, depending on the demands of the team and company. Your skills may be used in various ways, and you’re willing to go above and beyond the call of duty to aid others in succeeding. This not only establishes you as a strong team player but also demonstrates to others that you are capable of more than simply your current duty. As a result, imagining you in other roles in the future isn’t such a stretch.

11 General Entry-Level Interview Questions to Expect | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/entry-level-interview-questions/,"Early in your career, it’s normal to feel nervous about the job interview process. After all, first impressions are so powerful that 33 percent of hiring managers make up their minds in the first 90 seconds of the interview!

To make sure your first few interviews go well, you’ll want to know common entry-level interview questions. Read on as we go over 11 entry-level interview questions and answers that you should be ready for.

11 Questions You’ll Likely Be Asked in an Interview
Standard Questions
1. Tell Me About Yourself.

Hiring managers tend to ask this (extremely common) question early on as a way to get the ball rolling. The point is not to uncover your life’s story. Rather, they want to learn about your professional background, skills you’ve picked up along the way and a little bit about the journey that led you to apply for the position.

How to answer: Answering “Tell me about yourself” is easier with a framework in place. Yale University’s Office of Career Strategy advisors suggest good answers to this question feature a “motivational story” that communicates how and why you decided to work in your chosen field. If you’re new in your career, you can discuss your passion for the industry, eagerness to learn and how any past positions have prepared you for this role.

2. How Did You Hear About This Position?

This question can give interviewers a chance to figure out whether or not you have a real passion for the company you’re applying for.

How to answer: Answer honestly, but make sure to highlight any connections you may have to the business and why you’d like to work there. You can mention what led you to search for the role and what stood out to you about the company that spurred your decision to apply.

3. Why Should We Hire You?

With every question, the interviewer is trying to understand whether you’ll be a good fit for the role. This question is an opportunity for them to be direct. Hiring managers expect an explanation of how you and the company can mutually benefit if you’re employed.

How to answer: Showcase what makes you stand out from the sea of candidates. What special quality or skill do you bring to the table? If possible, speak about a core value of the company that resonates with you. Round out your answer by discussing what you’d like to accomplish while in the role.

4. What Are Your Weaknesses?

You’re not perfect, and the interviewer knows that. This question aims to determine whether you can self-evaluate, identify shortcomings and overcome weaknesses. The interviewer is also looking for warning signs such as a lack of accountability.

How to answer: An interviewer will see through a phony answer. Your best bet is to talk about a real flaw that is relatively insignificant. Don’t pick a weakness that relates to a central skill you’ll need for the job. Instead, talk about a less consequential one and share how you are working to fix it.

 

Past Experiences
5. What Achievement Are You Proudest Of?

Employers are searching for candidates that are go-getters. The interviewer wants to know what makes you special. After all, they are considering multiple candidates.

How to answer: When answering this question, don’t be afraid to shine a light on what you are most proud of. A mistake that some candidates make is thinking that talking about significant accomplishments will come across as arrogant. This is not the case. Discuss the achievement, how you accomplished the goal, an obstacle that may have come up and the result.

6. Tell Me About A Time You Demonstrated Leadership Skills.

Leadership-related questions are more common in interviews for higher-level positions. But it’s still a good idea to be prepared for them when looking at interview questions for entry-level positions. An interviewer can use this question to find out if you have the potential to take on a management role in the future.

How to answer: If you’re interviewing, you should know about the STAR technique. STAR stands for situation, task, action and result. Using this layout, tell the interviewer a short story about a time you showed leadership.

7. Tell Me About A Time You’ve Failed.

This isn’t a fun question to answer, but it gives hiring managers a chance to see how candidates handle setbacks. Every job comes with its challenges, so the hiring manager is looking for someone who can adapt and bounce back.

How to answer: Don’t sugar-coat things. The hiring manager wants to hear about a real failure, but they’d also like to hear about what you learned from that experience. Don’t stop after explaining the downside; end on a positive note with the lessons you took away from the experience.

8. Why Are You Leaving Your Current Position?

Careful, now! As tempting as it might be to trash-talk your current employer, that’s definitely not what the interviewer is asking for. This question gives an interviewer a look into your motivations behind applying for the job.

How to answer: Stick to a positive tone while answering this question. Focusing on how you’re ready to take on new challenges is a good idea. Share what you learned in your past role and how you’re ready to grow beyond it in this new one.

Looking Forward
9. Where Do You See Yourself In Five Years?

Neither you nor the interviewer knows what the future holds. What they really want to see is a realistic career plan that lines up with their company. Will you leave as soon as another opening pops up or stick around to grow and add value to the company?

How to answer: Talk about your plans and how the job would play into those goals. If there are certain skills that you want to develop, discuss how this job fits. You can also ask the interviewer a few questions about the professional development opportunities the company offers.

10. What Are Your Passions?

Not every question in an interview is related to the job — at least, not directly. With questions like these, interviewers can learn about candidates’ personalities and picture how well they would fit in with the culture of the company.

How to answer: Your answer can focus on work, but if you’ve got an exciting hobby, talk about that. It’s really about building rapport with the interviewer and showing that there’s more to you than the bullet points on your resume.

11. When Can You Start?

Hiring managers are often working on a time crunch. In most cases, they are looking for candidates with open schedules ready to get to work. However, in some cases, they are hiring ahead of schedule to anticipate a need.

How to answer: Be realistic about your start date. If you are currently working at another company, you may need to put in a two-week notice to leave respectfully. Additionally, if you have to relocate for the role, this will play into your timeline. The employer should be willing to work with you if you provide them with the most accurate information.

When Should I Start Applying for Jobs if I Graduate in May?

The timing of your job search will vary based on your unique situation. However, you’ll want to start searching for potential jobs as soon as you can. When it comes to applying, send out applications at least one or two months before you’ll be ready to get to work.

Many students wonder if it’s okay to apply for jobs before officially graduating and earning their degree. The answer is yes! Hiring managers are often willing to hire students a couple of months (or more) before the official graduation date and then onboard them once they are officially a graduate.

So, don’t worry about sending out applications too early. Instead, focus on creating a plan of action that keeps the job search moving steadily throughout the school year.

Here’s a job search timeline that you can follow.

Fall Semester: Research

Do your research. At the start of senior year, take some time to solidify the type of job you want after graduation. Consider:

What industry you want to work in
The size of the company you want to be a part of
The ideal location(s) you would like to be in
The absolute musts that the job should have (room for professional growth, ability to share ideas freely, innovative culture, etc.)
The things that you don’t want in a job (lack of collaboration, long commute, no work/life balance, etc.)

Using your list, hone in on what careers and companies might be a good fit for you. Also, think about how the skills you’ve learned in your classes could be put to use. This is a great time to talk with a career counselor and ask peers and recent grads about their job plans. Keep an open mind during this phase and create a list of potential jobs and companies you are interested in. Review the typical requirements to see how you stack up.

Then, start networking: talk to people in your life who could make for good references, and find people who work in the industry you’re trying to break into.

Winter: Get Ready

As the year moves on, it’s time to enter into the preparation phase. Winter break provides a great opportunity to focus your efforts on the job hunt. If your schedule allows, sign up for classes in the spring semester that will help you build relevant skills. Also, consider applying for an internship that will give you real-world experience in the field you’re hoping to start a career in.

Continue browsing sites like Linkedin and Handshake to look for jobs you could see yourself in. Also, keep in touch with people from your network. They may be able to connect you with a hiring manager or employee at a company you’re interested in.

During this phase, be sure to dust off that resume and update it to be ready for use. You’ll also need to have a professional cover letter at the ready. Have an administrator at the career center look over your resume to get input about how to improve. Once you have the documents perfected, you can move on to the next phase.

Spring Semester: Apply

While the spring semester typically begins in January, it’s common to begin applying for jobs around the end of March or the beginning of April. This gives a nice cushion between the spring semester and graduation.

So, start sending out applications! Reach out to your network, career coach, peers and other connections to see if you can get your foot in the door at a company you’re interested in. Also, send out applications on job sites and see who you hear back from.

When the companies you’ve applied to ask about setting up an interview, you need to be prepared. InterviewFocus is an incredibly useful online interview preparation tool that helps you hone your interview skills. The more interviews you rock, the more potential job offers you’ll have to consider. So be sure to take interview preparation seriously.

What Soon-to-Be Graduates Should Know About Applying for Jobs

Companies are always on the lookout for rising talent. College-educated applicants have an advantage over those without a degree. But you’ll need more than a degree to remain competitive.

Your prospects are particularly good if you’re focusing on industries like chemical manufacturing and wholesale trade. However, if your skills lie elsewhere, don’t let that discourage you. Focus on continually growing your skills and acing the interview to open new doors in the professional world.

In Which Month Do Companies Hire Most?

Recruiters hire year-round…but there are definitely trends. Fall and winter are often busy, while the summer months are slower.

The biggest takeaway for college students? You’ll want to get those job applications out ASAP. On-campus recruiting tends to occur during the spring and fall semesters, with companies looking for students getting ready to graduate in the spring and aim to have these hires set by early June.

Tips on Applying for Jobs Before You Graduate

Ready to go after that dream job? Take these three helpful tips along with you during the job search.

Tip #1: Go to Job Fairs

College job fairs help students network and explore their career options. These events are worth attending — the connections you make there could even help you get an interview someday! (Of course, landing an interview is only half the battle. Before your interview, take time to make sure you’re prepared.)

Tip #2: Seek Out Unadvertised Jobs

When it comes to job applications, the less competition there is, the better — and what’s better than a job opening that isn’t even advertised? To find these, ask people you know and reach out to your contacts at companies. It may take some digging, but the results may be well worth it.

Tip #3: Know How To List Your Degree

If you aren’t sure how to include your graduation date and degree on your resume before you graduate, don’t worry. Just list your expected graduation date — employers will understand you won’t be graduating until that time.

Make The Most Of Your Interview

No matter when you start looking for jobs, you’ll need to excel during the interview process to get hired. InterviewFocus’ mock interviews and patented AI technology will boost your soft skills, giving you the edge you need to stand out in the crowded job market.

Interview Questions to Test 10 Different Soft Skills | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/soft-skills-interview-questions-answers/,"When you step into an interview, you’re on a mission to position yourself as the best candidate for the job. To do so, it’s important to showcase the soft skills that employers are after. 

What exactly are soft skills? Soft skills are professional assets that an employer can’t teach easily (though they can be learned). Soft skills that you may be familiar with include time management, collaboration, communication, critical thinking and more. 

According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 97% of employers find soft skills just as important or more important than hard skills. Job seekers need to keep that statistic in mind when talking about what they can bring to the table. 

While it may be impossible to reconstruct one’s personality and experiences for an interview, the potential employee can highlight the soft skills they possess. Want to learn how to address soft skills during the interview process? Keep reading to nail down the perfect responses to soft skills interview questions.

10 Interview Questions That Test Your Soft Skills 

Applicants often talk about past job experiences and hard skills during an interview. While this is important, much of this is already on your resume. So it’s important to find windows of opportunity to discuss your soft skills in an interview. For ideas on weaving soft skills into your answers to common interview questions, read on.

Tell me about yourself—what is your experience?

While it’s good to mention professional details (previous employment, career path), this is also a good chance to jump into mentioning some soft skills.

Don’t immediately respond with, “Hi, I’m Jessica, and I’m a great communicator.” If possible, tell a short story that displays your proficiency in a certain soft skill. Or tie your soft skills into your discussion of previous work experiences. 

For example, “In my previous role, collaboration was a huge part of achieving goals. Learning how to communicate effectively within my department and with other departments in the company was a valuable part of that role. I’m excited to put those same teamwork and communication skills to work in this position.”

What is your biggest strength?

Of course, this is the right place to mention any hard skills relevant to the job. But don’t forget to mention soft skills as well. Pick one or two and explain why they are relevant. Don’t just say that critical thinking is key in marketing, for example, but explain that it’s important to use critical thinking skills when understanding the target audience. 

For guidance on what soft skills to highlight, check out the job description. There are most likely soft skills in the description that the employer has specifically stated they would like.

What is your biggest weakness?

This is a question that applicants dread being asked. But answering the “What is your biggest weakness?” question is easier when you’re prepared. And your answer doesn’t have to be perfect—the hiring manager understands that everyone has areas that can be improved. 

To weave soft skills into this answer, you can talk about a certain skill you’ve struggled with but are currently working to improve. Just make sure that the skill you talk about is not a core part of the job. For instance, saying that you struggle to stay organized in a fast-paced environment won’t go well. 

Tell me about a challenging situation you’ve experienced at work. How did you handle it?

Whether this is your first job interview or your 50th, you can expect a few behavioral interview questions to pop up. To answer, pick a situation that required soft skills to save the day. A great example to discuss would be a conflict between teams. 

Maybe the sales team didn’t agree with how the marketing team was trying to attract customers, and it took interpersonal skills to get everyone to the same side. Whatever it is, don’t blame others, and highlight how the situation was handled. Practice saying the story ahead of time to cut out unnecessary details and ensure that the answer is relevant.

How would your friends describe you?

There are a few variations to this question, like “How would your coworkers describe you?” or “What are three words that your friends/colleagues would use to describe you?” No matter how phrased, this soft skills interview question provides the perfect opportunity to share the positive traits you possess.

The hiring manager wants to know what kind of person you are beyond your resume and if you’d fit into the company culture. You can approach this question by sharing a story that illustrates one of your strengths. Alternatively, you can pick one key trait that you’ve showcased throughout your relationships that really stands out.

What are some things you like to do outside of work?

There is no right answer to this question because the hiring manager just wants to get to know you better. Instead of racking your brain for a response that’ll make you seem cool, pick a few of your favorite hobbies, and work in soft skills that feel natural.

Go for a run every morning? This showcases discipline and stress management. Part of a book club? This is a great indicator that you love learning and socializing. Whatever extracurricular you mention, make sure it highlights positive traits. 

Why did you apply for this job?

If you read the job description and researched the company, this interview question should be a breeze. Explain aspects of the job description or company that appealed to you, like the opportunity to work in a collaborative atmosphere or with a group that strives to produce the highest quality of work.

Employers are looking for someone who doesn’t mention that they were applying for every job out there because they were desperate or someone who didn’t even read the job description. While you want to have a good answer, the takeaway here is to say something about the job that shows you are actually interested. 

Where do you see yourself in five years?

Whether you are a new college graduate or a career professional, there is no foolproof response. According to The Muse, the best response is to be realistic about your long-term career goals and how you see the role helping you get there. 

So, what does this mean for you? Be honest, but bring up any goals related to the job. A driven person who is well-rounded in what they want out of life will appear more interesting than someone who doesn’t know or someone who doesn’t care to grow. 

How would your current/previous manager rate your performance?

This is another question where it’s obviously best to be positive. In other words, don’t say your manager dislikes you. As far as exactly how to respond, though, the best approach is to mention specific areas where you have successfully worked.

It’s okay to bring up some areas where you had to improve as well, but make sure to show that you have learned from your mistakes and grown as an employee. Remember to work in soft skills—pick 2-3 talents you have and harp on those. 

What questions do you have for me?

This is a great time to emphasize that soft skills are important from a candidate’s perspective as well. Ask about the team you’ll be working with to try and gauge some of the personalities and level of collaboration.

First Job Interview: Tips & What to Expect | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/tips-for-first-job-interview/,"Having pre-interview jitters? You’re not alone. In fact, 92% of adults in the U.S. report feeling nervous about at least one part of the interview, according to a national Harris Poll.

However, the days leading up to your first job interview don’t need to be a time of stress and anxiety. With the right preparation tactics and a solid idea of what to expect, you can confidently perform.

So take a deep breath, and read the practical first job interview tips below. When the interview rolls around, you’ll be glad you did.

Preparing for the Interview

Understanding how to prepare for the first job interview is the first step to success. For many, it’s difficult to know where to start. That’s why we’ve broken down the interview process into four central components below.

Your Knowledge of the Company and Role

Step number one is performing research on the company you’ll be interviewing with. Whether you’re interviewing with a Fortune 500 company or a small business, having an understanding of the company will help you in more ways than one.

First, you’ll have more to talk about with the interviewer if you’re informed about the company. Second, it will show that you care enough about this role to invest time researching the organization. Lastly, as you learn more about the company, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of what they are all about. This allows you to assess whether you align with the firm.

Here are a few areas of the company that are worth looking into before the interview:

The target market and primary products/services 
Values and mission statement 
History and important leadership (know who the CEO is)
Company culture 
Recent events (new product launches, initiatives, partnerships, etc.)

Of course, it’s not possible to know everything about the company. That’s not the point here. You simply want to gather enough information so that you come across as engaged and informed. This brings us to the next section of the interview preparation.

Your Answers

Now that you’ve looked into the company, it’s time to dive into some practice. Start with a list of common interview questions. You can also look around online for company-specific interview questions that past candidates sometimes share. Once you have a list of questions, it’s time to craft your responses.

While your answers to interview questions should be unique to you and your experiences, there are some general guidelines to follow.

1. Stay on topic

When formulating your responses, include relevant details that put you in a positive light. There’s no need to ramble on or dive into topics that don’t help the interviewer assess whether you’d be a good fit.

2. Use the STAR format

Speaking of staying on topic, the STAR format is a great framework for answering questions in your first job interview.

STAR stands for situation, task, action and result and refers to the order in which you should present a story that showcases your relevant skills. For a question that pairs perfectly with a STAR response, view number seven on this list of common interview questions. 

3. Be Truthful 

A CareerBuilder report found that 75% of HR managers have spotted a lie on a resume. Imagine how much more awkward getting caught in a lie during the interview would be. That would not help your chances of getting the job. So aim to be honest and accurate in each response.

If you’re worried about coming across as underqualified, scan your past involvement for relevant skills. You’ve likely picked up important skills from group projects, extracurricular activities and community involvement.

Your Appearance

Clothing is one form of nonverbal communication that speaks volumes. When preparing your ideal interview attire, aim for a neat and modest look. If you’re feeling uncertain about what to wear for your first job interview, analyzing the company culture and the industry can help you decide.

The level of formality will depend on the company. For instance, a finance firm will require a business professional look, while a creative marketing agency would call for a business casual outfit. When in doubt, it’s better to dress up rather than going too casual.

Before the interview, try on the complete outfit to make sure it fits well and that you can sit comfortably in it. Examine the outfit carefully to ensure that the fabric is free of stains, tears or anything else that would communicate a lack of attention to detail.

Your Confidence Levels

An essential step in preparing for your first job interview is practice. This is what will help calm your nerves so you can project confidence throughout the interview. But how do you practice for an interview?

Going over questions and answers in the mirror is not enough. Since you’re new to this communication format, a mock interview will give you the practice you need to put your skills to the test. To get the best out of your mock interview, you’ll want to utilize a platform that provides feedback on your performance.

Remember, learning how to prepare for tough interview questions requires multiple rounds of change to: practice. So don’t be discouraged if you have trouble. Just keep practicing and working to improve yourself for the big day of the actual interview.

5 Tips for Acing Your First Job Interview

You’ve done the research, selected a suitable outfit and gone through some mock interviews. Now, remember these five helpful tips for the first job interview.

1. Treat everyone well (not just the hiring manager)

From the secretary who greets you to the other candidates you may encounter, be kind and respectful to each person you come in contact with. This can make you memorable for all the right reasons when it comes time to decide who gets the job.

2. Have questions ready for the interview

You don’t want to end the interview on an unimpressive note. When the interviewer asks if you have any questions, pull out a list you’ve prepared ahead of time. Make sure you ask some interesting questions, not ones with answers that can easily be found online.

3. Bring a notebook and pen with you 

One way to stand out and to help gather your thoughts during the interview is to take notes. This is a great way to show the interviewer that you are engaged. Plus, writing can help to calm any nervousness you may be feeling at the start.

4. Be mindful of body language

Roll your shoulders back and sit up straight during an interview. Look the interviewer in the eye to establish trust. These may seem like minor details, but nonverbal communication plays a large role in how others perceive you.

5. Thank the interviewer  

Within 24 hours of the interview, send a note thanking the interviewer for their time. This can be a physical note or an email. Either way, you’ll show the interviewer that you appreciate the opportunity and look forward to joining the team.

How Much Your First Job Out of College Really Matters | InterviewFocus,https://interviewfocus.com/how-much-a-first-job-after-college-matters/,"Leaving college and entering the workforce is a thrilling experience. But it can also be a time of uncertainty. After spending all your life as a student, it’s finally time to step into a full-fledged profession.

Finding the right first job out of college can set you up for a promising career path and connect you with professionals that can help you excel. But how much does this first step after college truly matter?

Read on as we evaluate the importance of the first post-college job and discuss how to land an amazing one.

Why Your First Job Out of College Matters

You might think that your initial job post-college doesn’t matter much. As long as you’re employed, you’re on a good career path, right? Not exactly.

Your initial job after college matters for many reasons. After all, you did not spend tens of thousands of dollars to end up in a job that you dread or in a role that offers no interesting challenges. Let’s examine how that shiny new role affects your professional future.

Building Up Relevant Skills

When it comes to job readiness, many employers report that college students lack certain core skills, including professionalism and problem solving. The first position you take after college has the potential to sharpen these skills and make you a more valuable employee.

A role that allows you to develop as a professional is a launchpad for success. After building up these competencies, you’ll have the ability to rise to new challenges. You can leverage these new skills to negotiate a promotion, land a better role at a new company or even step out of your comfort zone and launch your own business.

Networking For Future Success

The opportunity to network is another reason you should give some thought to your first role after graduation. Working at a company filled with skilled professionals and upwardly mobile people offers perks in the short and long term. The right first job can introduce you to professionals and allow you to make a name for yourself in the industry.

Additionally, networking right out of college can help pave the road to future endeavors. Over half of open jobs are never advertised on job boards. Many employers turn to others in the industry for hiring recommendations. If you’ve been building connections since you entered the workforce, your name could be submitted. So consider your future when looking for the right job after college.

Avoiding the Underemployment Trap

We often hear about unemployment. But underemployment is the less discussed pitfall that new college grads face. When you are underemployed, you’re working at a job that does not allow you to put your knowledge and skills to work. For instance, a new grad with a political science degree who takes a job as a barista is underemployed, even if they work full time.

According to The Strada Institute, workers underemployed in their first job are five times more likely to stay underemployed when examined five years later. This is a significant reason why your first job out of college is important. To avoid stagnating in a less than desirable role, put in the work to find great employment right out of college. There’s more information on this below!

How to Land a Great First Job Out of College

Now that you have your degree, it’s time to leverage it to find a position that will give you practical knowledge and advance your professional skill set. There’s no clear cut way to do this, but some guidelines will place you on the right track.

1. Determine What You Want

Before anything else, write down what you are looking for in a job. If you are unsure, start by writing what you don’t want. If there are certain tasks or aspects of past internships or jobs that you disliked, put these on the “no” side of the list.

On the “yes” side, include aspects of a role that you would like to have. For example, the ability to work on a team, work on meaningful projects or shape the direction of your department might be on this side of the list.

While you might not get all the boxes checked, having a guideline will help you filter out jobs you know are the wrong fit. Plus, it’s easier to land your dream job if you’ve clearly defined it ahead of time.

2. Tap Into Your Professional Network

Armed with the list of what you desire in a job, it’s time to start hunting. Of course, online job boards are a great place to start. But don’t stop there. Your network can connect you to roles that you otherwise would have missed. Since 51% of millennials report feeling uncomfortable asking connections about job referrals, many miss out on open roles and potential dream jobs. Don’t make the same mistake.

Instead, approach your network respectfully, and don’t be afraid to hear no. Turn to your professors, alumni network, career coach and other connections from your university days. You can even ask old classmates if their companies are hiring more new grads. Put yourself out there and see what opportunities come your way.

3. Revamp the Resume and Cover Letter

Next, take a look at your resume and ensure it is up to date. While mentions of high school involvement on your resume may have worked in college, they should be removed now that you are a graduate. Focus on highlighting internships and community involvement activities that you were a part of during your undergrad career.

When it comes to cover letters, remember to craft a tailored one for each job application. You may be applying for many jobs, but a generic cover letter won’t impress a recruiter. Add details specific to each role to make every cover letter unique and impactful.

4. Make Time For Interview Prep

Last but not least, prepare for the interview. Whether it will be a virtual interview or an in-person one, this is your chance to sell yourself as the best candidate for the role. Research the company ahead of time and have a list of questions you can ask the interviewer ready to go.

Coming across as collected and confident in the interview is vital, especially as a new college graduate. Because the interview is such an important part of securing the job, utilizing an interview preparation system to analyze your strengths and weaknesses is a great idea.

What to Do if You Don’t Like Your New Job

While your first job after graduating from college does play a role in your career trajectory, it’s not the end all be all. If your job does not offer room for growth or does not align with your interests, it’s important to change course as soon as possible. Here are a few steps to follow in this situation.

Give Yourself Time to Adjust

Shifting from a varied college schedule to a structured, full-time role is no small task. Don’t expect to hit your stride right away. If you feel anxious or overwhelmed at your new job, you’re not alone. However, you need to evaluate whether it is the job you don’t like or the many new challenges you’re facing as a college graduate.

After some time, you may find that you enjoyed the role and were simply getting used to the demands of a full-time role. If this is not the case, it’s time to explore other options. Using the tips above, conduct a job search to find a new role.

Resign Respectfully

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that millions of professionals switch occupations throughout their careers. So you don’t need to feel guilty about leaving your place of work. Just make sure you’re not burning bridges on the way out.

Give your supervisor advanced notice of your exit and thank them for the opportunity when you leave. Be sure to stay connected with your colleagues on Linkedin, especially if you’re staying in the same industry. You never know how your past connections will come in handy.

Wow the Interviewer to Land Your Dream Job

Hitting your stride in the professional world starts with getting the job you want. Before you walk into the interview, make sure you’re ready for whatever comes your way. InterviewFocus is state-of-the-art software that is revolutionizing the interview preparation process.
