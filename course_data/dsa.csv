Hard,Explain the concept of a Randomized Binary Search Tree.,A Randomized Binary Search Tree (or Treap) combines binary search tree properties with heap properties using random priorities to maintain balanced tree structure with high probability.
Hard,How does the Dijkstra's algorithm find the shortest path in a graph?,Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights by iteratively selecting the node with the smallest tentative distance and updating distances to its neighbors.
Hard,Describe the concept of a Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation.,A Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation is an extension of the segment tree that allows efficient range updates and queries by deferring updates to segments until necessary reducing time complexity for range operations.
Hard,How does the Tarjan's algorithm find strongly connected components (SCCs)?,Tarjan's algorithm finds SCCs using depth-first search and maintains a stack of nodes along with low-link values to identify and group nodes into SCCs.
Hard,Explain the concept of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching.,The Gale-Shapley algorithm also known as the Deferred Acceptance algorithm finds a stable matching between two sets of elements such as students and schools by iteratively proposing and accepting matches based on preferences.
Hard,What is the purpose of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm in pattern matching?,The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently searches for occurrences of a pattern within a text by preprocessing the pattern to create a partial match table which allows skipping redundant comparisons.
Hard,How does the Kruskal's algorithm find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?,Kruskal's algorithm finds the MST by sorting all edges of a graph by weight and adding the smallest edge to the MST using a union-find data structure to avoid cycles and ensure connectivity.
Hard,Describe the concept of a Palindromic Tree.,A Palindromic Tree is a data structure used to efficiently find and store all distinct palindromic substrings of a given string supporting queries and modifications.
